			   news.software.nntp

Known Issues:
	- OLD: dreaderd: problem with corrupt header files caused
	  by what seems to be a lock race condition with 'dexpireover -R'.
	  This problem has existed for years.

Experimental (features/utilities that are new and/or not properly tested
  	      and hence should be used with care on production systems):
	- Compressed spools
	- Compressed feeds
	- IPv6 support
	- dnewsfeeds %include option
	- dexpirecache
	- dcancel

Summary of changes likely to impact an upgrade from 5.x
	- new dreader header index format. Cannot go back to
	  older versions as they will not be able to read
	  the new version.

Summary of changes likely to impact an upgrade from 4.x
	- history version 2 (offsets converted to indexes)
	- new history expire (dhisexpire)
	- fixed bug in dexpire.ctl inheritance handling

Summary of changes likely to impact an upgrade from 3.x
	- New spool storage format. Each article is stored with a binary
	  header. This new format is not usable with older versions of
	  diablo, although 4.x can read prior storage formats.

Diablo 5-current

2009-05-25
	* dreaderd: Don't know why no one ever noticed that tcp
	  socket options per user weren't getting set right.

2009-04-20
        * dcancel: Add the ability to cancel articles by article
          number in the reader header index. (from Michael Dorrington)

2009-04-18
	* Oops, never committed the stunnel patch for useproxied.

2009-02-01
	* parsedate wouldn't deal well with certain days of the
	  week that weren't capitalized

2009-01-28
	* Cleanup of various code problems, including new expire
	  cleanup, spaces-in-Newsgroups cleanup, etc.

2009-01-15
	* Implement alternate article numbering views for clients
	  (this version still needs some cleanup).  Clients may
	  indicate their capabilities via the XNUMBERING extension.

	  RFC977 imposes no real limits on article numbering.  This
	  may cause some issues with non-64-bit-clean clients.

	  RFC3977 imposes a 2^31-1 limit AND places restrictions
	  on the resetting of the low-water mark, which is excessively
	  retarded because it effectively means that once a group hits
	  the limit, it's just dead, but it's the behaviour that is
	  defined in the RFC.

	  WINDOW guarantees compatibility with non-64-bit-clean
	  clients by restricting the article numbers to a window
	  between 1 and 2^31-1; further, the number of articles in
	  a group is limited to guarantee that most clients should
	  detect it as a "group reset" along the various lines of
	  ill-defined logic often used by clients.  It is not a
	  frequent event, but when it happens, this has the best
	  possibility of being successful without being too
	  disruptive.

	  Another patch shortly will clean this code up, and will
	  allow for selection of which view to present by default
	  to clients who do not explicitly request a particular
	  view.

2008-12-24
	* Absolutely huge changes that have been underway for more
	  than half a year.  

	  There are a set of interrelated but different problems
	  going on in the system.

	  The first is that the legacy overview code was not 64-bit
	  safe; this effectively limited overviews for a group to
	  around 60 million articles and then wackiness happened.  
	  The code has been walked through and updated so that on 
	  64-bit platforms, larger overviews are possible (we've 
	  exercised it to 500 mil). 32-bit platforms currently lose
	  due to the inability of the operating system to map large 
	  files, but support for this is also possible and a cleanly 
	  coded solution may be committed in the future.

	  Further, article numbering is a disaster waiting to happen.
	  The legacy code is organized to handle 31-bit message 
	  numbers.  Certain alt.binaries high volume groups are 
	  poised to pass message number 2^31-1.  Now, on one hand,
	  the problem could be solved by simply 64-bit-ifying the
	  code to handle 63-bit article numbers.  On the other hand,
	  some nimrods decided to specify 2^31-1 as a maximum article
	  number in RFC3977, which, fortunately, we don't really 
	  claim compliance with.  This code revision simply extends
	  the article numbering to 2^63.  In doing so, it will update
	  your overview files from VERSION 3 to VERSION 4.  This is
	  a harmless change except for groups where article numbering
	  exceeds 2^31-1.  Some effort was put into keeping the files
	  otherwise-compatible with older code.

	  Note that if you are using Diablo as an article numbering
	  master, you will need to update Diablo AND dreaderd.

	  People running this codebase will be able to have larger
	  overviews and won't run into a problem at artno 2^31-1.

2008-12-22
	* Various compiler warning cleanups

2008-12-19
	* Runaway spool thread status flag repurposing, based on a 
	  strategy POC'd by tim@euroaccess (thanks for the headaches, 
	  grin)

2008-12-18
	* Various compiler warning cleanups

2008-12-18
	* It's 2008.  Everyone has zlib.  If I don't hear objections, I
	  will probably be slowly removing conditional support for it.

2008-12-18
	* Add error checking for group resizing; many platforms limit
	  calloc memory availability and application of an "unlimit" or
	  equivalent in the daily.reader script might be required.  This
	  just adds a reasonable error message

2008-12-18
	* Add compressed header transmission to clients (XZVER support)
	  Newshosting and a few other places have been running this for
	  almost a year without any complaints, but it is still in
	  testing.

2008-12-16
	* drgpctl masscancel: support cancellation of large numbers of
	  articles from very large groups (one-pass through the overview
	  file)

2008-12-15
	* Dump threads status from sigUsr1 (can't find who submitted this
	  patch, apologies, whoever)

2008-12-15
	* Report virtual server name in log lines

2008-12-15
	* Bump max TCP buffer size to 2048K

2008-12-06
	* fwrite patch to allow for proper bytes accounting in Diablo

2008-08-01
	* Patch from Avi, reworked, to provide coredumps on Linux

2008-04-02
	* I didn't realize this hadn't actually made it into dreaderd.  A
	  patch to use new CMSG macros for file descriptor passing, needed
	  to make most 64-bit architectures happy.

2008-03-30
	* I've thrown support for UseProxied into dreaderd, but it is not
	  complete or correct at this time.  Using it will probably result
	  in a file descriptor leak.  Anyone interested in adding support
	  for SSL via stunnel, and who's interested in hacking on the code
	  a bit, can contact me for further information on how this works. 
	  <jgreco@ns.sol.net>

2008-02-28
	* Fix Solaris compatibility issue; looks like they now use u_32_t
	  instead of u_int32_t

2007-11-30
	* Tagged 5.1-REL

Diablo 5.1-REL

2007-11-16
	* dreaderd: Fix a posting corruption bug that apparently has
	  always been there (sigh).

2007-11-05
	* dreaderd: Add support for Maximum Age Policy
	* diablo: Add support for Maximum Age Policy
	  This feature controls the maximum article age that can be
	  retrieved from a spool.

2007-09-11
	* dreaderd: Add some debugging information to dns.c to log
	  label failures more clearly

2007-07-11
	* dreaderd: Cleanup old references to POST_HIDENNTPPOSTHOST
	  Cleanup Linux CFLAGS

	  Thanks to: Michael Dorrington <mike@zen.co.uk>

2007-01-03
	* dreaderd: Minor programming style fix; "improper" use of zfree.

2006-09-21
	* diablo: Separate out IFILTER hash based Message-ID refusals;
	  these were getting lumped in with history refusals.

2006-08-21
	* drequeue: Fix five-year-old command line parsing bug

2006-06-29
	* diablo: Log something in the incoming log when an IFILTER hash
	  rule is tripped.

2006-05-18
	* diablo: Clean up a spool bug

	  From: Koos de Haan <koos@kabelfoon.nl>
	  After some investigation i found that the cause lays in the fact we
	  are using an unwanted metaspool without any spools in it. This to
	  dump articles in groups we don't want to carry (guess this it rarely
	  used since i am the first to hit this bug)

2005-12-28
	* dreaderd: Introduce BIG_MBUF define for dreaderd.

	  Large sites with memory to burn may benefit from defining BIG_MBUF
	  in vendor.h.  This will allow more buffering of data and reduced
	  syscall load.

2005-12-26
	* dreaderd: Add an ART_AGE option for dreaderd as well.

	  STATS_ART_AGE affects the Diablo spooler, and reports the approx.
	  time since the article was received by the spooler, in seconds.
	  This is only accurate to within ten minutes due to the data 
	  available from the history.

	  STATS_ART_AGE_DR affects the dreaderd system, and reports the
	  seconds between the current time and the time in the Date:
	  header of retrieved articles coming from spool servers.


2005-11-01
	* IMPORTANT: The hashfeed system has changed.  The first few
	  iterations may be painful on non-FreeBSD platforms as I have
	  few alternative platforms to test on.

	  Hashfeed has been greatly enhanced to use MD5 based hashing,
	  which allows a much greater mod value, but also allows multiple
	  tiers of hash support.  More details in hashfeed.c for the
	  interested.  See samples/ for changes.

	  If you use hashfeed for deterministic article routing and
	  location, YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE YOUR CONFIG FILES.  The
	  old hash values are still supported, with a different syntax.

2005-10-23
	* dspoolout: For reasons unknown, the nobatch option never made
	  it from the old dnntpspool.ctl format to the new unified
	  dnewsfeeds file format.

2005-10-16
	* diablo: Add feedertxbuf/feederrxbuf to dnewsfeeds.
	  Set the TCP buffer sizes for this connection, overriding what
	  was set globally on the command line.  This would seem to be a
	  useful optimization especially on spool servers, where the
	  inbound feed ought to have a large rx buffer/small tx buffer,
	  but the spool connections should be just the opposite.

2005-10-16
	* Correct more examples of not checking return values from
	  system calls.  In this case, diablo silently ignores failure
	  of setsockopt calls to set buffer sizes, something which can
	  easily fail.

2005-10-10
	* Pass remote IP data via NetRemote.  JG20050804

2005-02-20
2005-07-30
	  Patch to line 1092 of diablo.c - turn off spurious reports of
	  closing the external filter - if in a child process - the child
	  process does not interact with the filter in that way.

	  Patch from mohan

2005-02-20 through 2005-06-04
	* lots of patches were done and not documented, blame Mike.

2005-02-20
	* diablo: Ben O'Hara found a place we didn't use the %include
	  code, reasons unknown. 

2005-02-17
	* diablo: #ifndef-wrap MAXFORKS/MAXFEEDS.  We've had this little
	  change for a long time and I'm not sure how it never got
	  committed.  This allows you to override these at the top of
	  vendor.h, along with FD_SETSIZE, if you want to make this sort
	  of compile-time change.  (It worked to do this without this
	  patch, but it generated compiler warnings...)

2005-01-16
	* dgrpctl: Add an option to specify an absolute new
	  value for NB, NE or NX. Improvements to usage
	  description and man page.
	  Submitted by: Frank Durda IV <uhclem.diablo at nemesis.lonestar.org>

2005-01-12
	* diablo: Fix a possible buffer overflow in the handling
	  of dspoool.ctl time handling when the time type is not
	  specified.
	  Reported by:  Dave Reader <dave @ undone.org.uk>

2005-01-12
	* dreaderd: Add a diablo.config option 'readeridenttimeout'
	  to specify the default timeout to be used for ident requests
	  if enabled. Can also use an authdef override. Also fix a
	  buffer handling problem in the returned user.
	  Reported by: Kristofer Pettijohn <kristofer+devnull @ cybernetik.net>
	  
2004-12-28
	* dreaderd: Don't let rate limits fall below 100cps.  If you want
	  someone to read news on a teletype, buy them a teletype.  :-)

2004-12-27
	* dreaderd: Allow per-readerdef setting of rxbufsize/txbufsize.
	  Recent changes seem to have broken the command line options, and
	  cmdline would not seem to be the best way to do that anyways, so
	  at some point we should probably retire -R/-T.

2004-12-26
	* dreaderd: Add "ratelimitrange", a way to randomly vary the rate 
	  limit of a session.  Set a range, like "80-120", and the otherwise 
	  applicable rate limit will be varied from 80% to 120% of that
	  number.  Minimum is 1%, maximum is 200%.

2004-12-25
	* dreaderd: Silent capping of TCP buffer sizes is bad policy.
	  Make it log a warning.  Also apply capping policy to spool
	  server connections. 

2004-12-24
	* dreaderd: Allow generating Xref: lines for articles with
	  whitespace in Newsgroups: header.
	  Submitted by: Cor Bosman <cor @ xs4all.nl>

2004-12-22
	* dreaderd: Fix a problem with dreaderd crashing when it
	  encounters a very large (usually corrupt) header. Also
	  decrease the maximum header size (and control article
	  size) that dreaderd accept to 512K by default.

2004-12-22
	* dreaderd: Allow the initial numarts for a group index
	  file to be any size the admin wants. We used to limit it
	  to 65536 arts

2004-12-22
	* diablo: When choosing the first spool object, pick one
	  randomly so that we don't overallocate the first one

2004-12-14
	* Add feedgraph to the contrib/ directrory. This program
	  creates a set of web pages of RRD graphs for feeds.
	  Submitted by: Kristofer Pettijohn <kristofer @ cybernetik.net>

2004-12-12
	* dexpireover: Fix a bug introduced on 2004-10-15 that
	  was causing dexpireover to use an incorrect file
	  size when rewriting data.
	  Submitted by: Cor Bosman <cor @ xs4all.nl>

2004-12-11
	* dreaderd: Add a dexpire.ctl option (l) to set the
	  oldest articles that dreaderd will fetch from a
	  spool server.
	  Submitted by: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels @ cistron.net>

2004-10-31
	* dreaderd: Improvements to MADVISE code
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2004-10-19
	* dreaderd: Add a lib/vendor.h option 'USE_OVER_MADVISE'
	  to enable the MADVISE of XOVER output as it has caused
	  problems for some people.

2004-10-15
	* feeder-stats.pl: Fixes and ehancements to feeder-stats
	  including reader stats and text output option.
	  Submitted by: FUNET Newsmaster <newsmaster @ news.funet.fi>
	  and Mike Horwath <drechsau @ gmail.com>

2004-10-15
	* dreaderd: Add 2 new options to dserver.hosts:
		retention=<time_in_second>
		groupdef=<list_of_groupdef>
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2004-10-15
	* dreaderd: Revisit using MADVISE for XOVER output and
	  do some sanity checking of dataentries.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2004-10-15
	* dexpireover: Fix a few bugs when using -R option
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>
	
2004-09-26
	* dreaderd: Add support for banning a user through the existing
	  custom error propagation facility.  Now you can return an auth
	  message like "110 600 <#mins> 502 Buzz off." 

	  The custom message will only be displayed to the current session.
	  Aside from the minutes, the normal readerban setup rules apply,
	  and you must have a readerban set for per-host bans.  It might
	  be nice to separate this functionality at some point, by creating
	  an AuthBan structure.

2004-09-25
	* dreaderd: Add new dserver.hosts flags to allow sleepy, sluggish,
	  and/or nonresponsive spool servers to be logged or have
	  connections reset.

2004-09-19
	* dexpire: Add an extension to the '-s' (sync filesystem) option
	  to specify how many files to delete before syncing.

2004-08-20
	* dreaderd/dexpireover: Fix a long running bug that caused dexpire.ctl
	  entry inheritance to not work.  WARNING: This may affect exiting
	  dexpire.ctl setups - check that your logic is what is expected.
	  Pointed out by: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels @ cistron.net>

2004-08-20
	* all: Allow setting of zero for rxbuf and txbuf to use
	  dynamically sized buffers for any OS that allows it.
	  Set defaults for dreaderd to zero.
	  Submitted by: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels @ cistron.net>

2004-08-07
	* diablo: Structures should be zeroed upon allocation.  Failure
	  to do so results in all sorts of unexpected behaviours when
	  someone adds a nifty new feature but isn't thorough about it,
	  thus causing all feeds generated from a legacy dnntpspool.ctl
	  based system to be started with a nice priority of 20.

2004-07-30
	* dreaderd: Undo the XOVER performance patch - it causes dreaderd
	  to go into a spin loop under certain circumstances.
	
2004-07-28
	* diablo: Clean up some of the various time_t-to-int printf issues
	  and other similar cleanups. 

2004-07-27
	* dreaderd: Add new option 'settos' to set the IP_TOS
	  setsockopt option, if available, to set TOS/QoS data
	  in the IP packet header.

2004-07-20
	* dreaderd: Improve performance of XOVER
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2004-07-20
	* dreaderd: Use internal md5 function so that hashed
	  NNTP-Posting-Host headers are enabled with the cryptpw
	  option in dreader.access.

2004-07-20
	* diablo: Add support for hsize up to 512m entries. Many
	  operating systems won't be able to handle more than 256m
	  due to mmap() limitations.

2004-07-11
	* dexpireover: Don't delete corrupt data entries by default.
	  Use '-RR' to remove corrupt entries.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2004-07-11
	* dexpireover: Do some sanity checking on the value of
	  dataentries in case it has become corrupt. This fixes
	  some of the corrupt overview problems.

2004-07-10
	* diablo: Allow activedrop to be on without active on.
	  Submitted by: Alex Kiernan <alex.kiernan @ gmail.com>
	
2004-07-10
	* doverctl: Fix relative path calculation to prevent valid files
	  being deleted with the 'clean' option.

2004-04-28
	* diablo: Add option in diablo.config to reject articles with
	  a CR with no corresponding LF.

2004-04-28
	* dnewslink: Allow sending to both IPv4 and IPv6 destinations
	  if both are in the DNS.
	  Submitted by: FUNET Newsmaster <newsmaster @ news.funet.fi>

2004-04-20
	* dcancel: Add the ability to cancel articles by article
	  number in the reader header index.

2004-04-20
	* dexpireover: Don't resize dataentries unless we are
	  rebuilding the data.

2004-04-05
	* Disable AIO by default for now. It has caused too many
	  reported problems. It is used when dreaderd tries to access
	  articles from a locally mounted spool.

2004-04-04
	* diablo: Unmap some a memory mapped area of history before
	  closing the history file. This fixes a problems where long
	  running diablo process were holding old history files open 
	  after they were deleted.

2004-03-03
	* diablo: Added a new option 'feedermaxheadersize' to diablo.config
	  with a default of 64k to limit the size of article headers that we
	  accept. Also reject articles with no blank line after the header.
	  Based on a patch from: Frank Durda IV <uhclem.diablo at nemesis.lonestar.org>

2004-02-22
	* dreaderd: Add a new dexpire.ctl option 'e' to specify the
	  number of headers stored in each header data file. See
	  dexpire.ctl for details.

2004-02-14
	* Tagged 5.0-REL

Diablo 5.0-REL

2004-01-30
	* dreaderd: Handle custom reject messages from external auth
	  by returning a readerdef in the format "nnn message" (i.e.
	  the entire returned string would be "110 502 Buzz off").

2004-01-22
	* dreaderd: Fix improper number of parameters bug
	  Special thanks to: Horwath!

2004-01-18
	* dreaderd: Add dreaderd cache scoring to weight caching in favour
	  of popular groups.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec at proxad.net>

2003-12-07
	* Some minor changes to sample cron scripts, including switching
	  to use dhisexpire by default.

2003-12-03
	* dreaderd: Fix AIO access for local spool under Linux
	  Submitted by: "Homme R. Bitter" <homme at cambrium.nl>

2003-11-25
	* dreaderd: Log article retrieval failures better (i.e. 423's).

2003-11-25
	* dreaderd: New option, addrealm, to tack on a realm to the user-
	  supplied authinfo.  Useful with virtual servers and complex 
	  environments.

2003-10-28
	* dreaderd: Fix XPAT problems relating to high CPU use by dreaderd.
	  Submitted by: Branko Lankester <branko at euro.net>

2003-10-08
	* dfeedtest: Add an option '-X' to show which spool an article would
	  be installed into. Also add '-M' to specify the Message-ID.

2003-09-07
	* diablo: Read the manner in which the article was stored from the
	  article header.  The previous code made it impossible for a spool
	  to be compressed and then set to uncompressed, despite the fact
	  that we ultimately read the data that told us the article had been
	  stored uncompressed...

2003-08-27
	* diablo: check the return value on the kill system call.  Failures
	  may be harmless, but then again they could signal a problem.

2003-08-01
	* dreaderd: bump the default THREAD_QSIZE up to 16.  Please report
	  any problems you encounter as a result of this change.

2003-07-31
	* dreaderd: post.c: silent dropping of obviously bogus and forged
	  headers is a *really* bad idea.  I don't know why I ever did it.
	  Furthermore, I missed X-Complaints-To, which resulted in a bunch
	  of bad stuff getting out on the 'net with multiple XCT's by a
	  spammer intent on confusing the issue.

	  Fixed by: JG

2003-06-01
	* dhisexpire: Fix bug in pointer use that could cause all entries
	  to be removed.

2003-05-30
	* dnewslink: Fix unmapping of articles bug introduced in the
	  recent performance enhancing patch.

2003-05-28
	* dsyncgroups: Add options to specify a username/password of the
	  remote system.
	  Submitted by: "Robert J. Adams (jason)" <radams @ siscom.net>

2003-05-25
	* dexpirecache: Fix a missing closedir() and significantly
	  reduce memory usage by doing a chdir() to the basepath, thus
	  not storing the basepath in each node.
	  Submitted by: Michael Haardt <michael @ freenet-ag.de>

2003-03-29
	* dspoolout: Don't rename a queue file if its size is zero

2003-03-15
	* dreaderd: Add some extra logging to 'info server' log line
	  Submitted by: Robert Kiessling <Robert.Kiessling @ de.easynet.net>

2003-03-14
	* dreaderd: Don't accept bad Message-ID's in TAKETHIS only mode

2003-03-02

	* dreaderd: Don't duplicate the body when client retrieves 
	  control messages.

2002-10-07
	* diablo: UCAR.EDU is burdening USENET with Yet More Binaries

	* diablo: Detect "bommanews" binary article type.

2002-08-20
	* diablo: Create a new spool file when we go over a size limit

	  reference (spool file offset) in dhistory.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2002-08-17
	* dreaderd: Allow different client ratelimits for various

	  over the reallocint time period.

2002-08-10
	* diablo: Add diablo.config option 'feederarttypes' which
	  allows the article type code to be disabled completely.

2002-08-10
	* dlockhistory: Add an option to lock the entire history file
	  into memory.

2002-08-08
	* diablo: Fix bug in history lookup offset calculation when
	  using history version 2.

2002-08-07
	* dreaderd: Improvements to PGP verification:
	   - fix a bug in the handling of lines beginning with
	     '-' sent to PGP.
	   - add diablo.config option "pgpverifyargs" which allows one
	     to specify the arguments used to run pgpverify.
	   - GNUPG support via command-line option to pgpverify

2002-08-06
	* diablo: Add the first stage of a modification to allow
	  a much larger number of entries in the history file.
	  When enabled, the history hash table will consist of
	  an index into the history file, rather than the offset.
	  This should allow history files with 2^32-2 entries
	  or (28 * 4)GB in size (for those operating systems that
	  allow files > 4GB. Note that the new history version is
	  not enabled yet as the code needs to be tested in its
	  current form first.

2002-08-05
	* dhisctl: Add option -h to dump the contents of the history
	  file header.

2002-08-04

	  Set this to 14 days to reflect what the documentation says.

2002-08-04
	* diablo: Add a new diablo.config option 'feedermaxacceptage'
	  to specify the maximum age of accepted articles. This allows
	  the age to be specified differently to the remember value
	  and is useful for reducing the size of the history file for
	  feeders/spools that won't be offered older articles.
	  Idea from: uhclemo @ nemesis.lonestar.org (Frank Durda IV)

2002-08-04
	* all: Fix the address specification of IPv6 addressed for
	  binding to ports. The address should now be enclosed within

	  and reducing the number of poll() calls in the general case.

2002-07-27
	* dhisbench: Improve options to allow concurrent adds and lookups
	  and better stats reporting.

2002-07-27
	* diablo: Reorder shutdown events so that dicmd reports exit
	  more nearly at the time we actually exit.

2002-07-23
	* dreaderd: Add a perl user authenticator, with a sample perl
	  script authenticating against an Oracle DB. Must be enabled

2002-07-15
	* diablo: Abort if we cannot create a spool directory.

2002-07-15
	* diablo: Keep track of the remember value as seconds so that
	  we don't have to calculate it for every article.
	  Modifed patch from: uhclemo @ nemesis.lonestar.org (Frank Durda IV)

2002-07-15
	* diablo: Modify parsedate to also convert hours and minutes
	  to give a more accurate date for an article and thus allowing
	  a finer calculation of article age vs remember. Note that
	  this still doesn't take into account timezones.
	  Submitted by: uhclemo @ nemesis.lonestar.org (Frank Durda IV)

2002-07-15
	* dexpire: Convert some counters to be able to handle larger numbers.

	* dreaderd: Fix some error messages that only included a trailing
	  '\n' instead of '\r\n'.
	  Reported by: Shawn Ramsey" <shawn @ cpl.net>

2002-07-08
	* Fix error in CIDR matching of IPv4 addresses against IPv6
	  addresses.

2002-07-04
	* dnewslink: Add a new option 'delayfeed' to specify the number
	  of seconds to delay articles in a feed. This is accomplished
	  by storing the receive time of articles into the dqueue file
	  and not offering the articles for that time + delayfeed secs.

2002-06-30
	* Add dhisctl for performing various actions on the history
	  file, like expiring specific articles.

2002-06-23
	* dnewslink: Fix bug where dnewslink would go into a loop on
	  connect failure, using CPU.

2002-06-17
	* all: Improve IPv6 compatability (Linux)
	  Modified patch from: FUNET Newsmaster <newsmaster @ news.funet.fi>

2002-06-16

	  reopening the history file after a change.

2002-05-17 (merged 4-stable: 2002-05-17)
	* all: Use correct install utility for AIX
	  Submitted by: Daniel Tiefnig <diablo @ qmail.infonova.at>

2002-05-16
	* diablo: Have Diablo report the (approximate) age of retrieved
	  articles.  For those sites running with distributed spools, 
	  this can help you judge just how big secondary spools need to
	  be in order to be most cost-effective.  Most articles retrieved 
	  tend to be recent, and by plugging these age values into a 
	  graphing program, it should become readily apparent what the 
	  best amount of time would be for storage on a secondary spool.

2002-05-16 (merged 4-stable: 2002-06-17)
	* dnewslink: Fix a problem with offering articles twice, introduced
	  in the fix for closing spool articles on a regular basis.

	* feeder-stats: Solaris 8 support and other updates.

2002-04-14
	* diablo: Add an option path_artlog to diablo.config to enable
	  logging of article size and group to a separate file.

2002-04-11
	* dreaderd: In session accounting, clients pipelining commands
	  at the server cause the server to incorrectly account on a
	  per-command basis.  The correct fix is in the works, but in
	  the meantime, account for "other" session bytes so that at
	  least things aren't slipping through the cracks.

2002-04-10
	* feeder-stats: Update to version 4
	  Submitted by: Xander Jansen <Xander.Jansen @ surfnet.nl>

2002-03-21 (merged 4-stable: 2002-07-11)
	* dreaderd: Use INN-style wildmat for full XPAT support.

2002-03-17 (merged 4-stable: 2002-03-23)
	* feeder-stats: Improvemnts to feeder-stats.pl
	    - localize LegendLabels to prevent re-use of wrong entries when
	      less than 7 labels
	    - concatenation of ImgDir and logo.gif more flexible
	    - suppression of errors like 'pathheader contains TAB' etc
	    - show variants of connection refused errors
	    - df -h instead of df -k on FreeBSD 4.x
	    - GetVolume now also for TeraBytes
	    - Top1000 now pointing to the Alternative Freenix
	    - added rejected volume and total outgoing volume to main index
	    - other minor bug fixes and credit/copyright additions
	  Submitted by: Xander Jansen <Xander.Jansen @ surfnet.nl>

2002-03-17 (merged 4-stable: 2002-03-23)

	  '\r\n.\r\n' when sending to the external filter.

2002-03-03 (merged 4-stable: 2002-03-23)
	* diablo: Log incoming stats when we have to abort (e.g: can't
	  create article file) an incoming connection.

2002-02-17 (merged 4-stable: 2002-03-03)
	* diablo: Detect the badly implemted binary type 'yenc'.

2002-01-31 (merged 4-stable: 2002-02-01)
	* dreaderd: Add a timeout for connections to spool
	  Submitted by: michael @ optusnet.com.au

2002-01-20
	* dhisexpire: Now modified to allow the history file to be
	  rewritten with zero downtime (only a very short delay) for
	  incoming connections (spool and feed). Also add a man page.
	  WARNING: This is not fully tested - feedback appreciated.

2002-01-12
	* dhisexpire: New utility to handle history rewrites that minimises
	  the diablo downtime. This is accomplished by only pausing the
	  diablo server when the expire is near the end of the history file.
	  WARNING: This is not fully tested - feedback appreciated.

Diablo 4.1-REL

2002-01-28 (merged 4-stable: 2002-01-31)
	* dreaderd: Fix an information leak in NEWNEWS that allowed

2002-01-04
	* all: Add support for Tru64/OSF1

2001-12-30
	* diablo: Improve the internal spamfilter. The filter now has
	  separate MD5 hash tables for the duplicate body and posting host
	  rate detectors and the options are all configurable. Both
	  detection types also keep track of the number of lines in the
	  body to help prevent false positives.
	  WARNING: The -S and 'internalfilter' options have changed
	  to accomodate this improvement.
	  See man/diablo.8 and samples/diablo.config for details.
	  
2001-12-30
	* dreaderd: Add an option 'readermaxartsize' to diablo.config
	  to allow the setting of a global maximum article size for

	  etc.

2001-12-13
	* all: Standardise all the logging routines, allowing logs to
	  be disabled or sent to syslog, a pipe or a file. See the path_*log
	  options in diablo.config for details.

	  messages for interactive use.

2001-11-17
	* diablo: Fix a history corruption bug by simplifying the way
	  we add entries to the history file. This also has the
	  side-effect of speeding up history adds by 10 times on my test
	  machine.

2001-11-17
	* dilookup: Improve usage and make it more flexible.

2001-11-17
	* history.c: Add an option to open the history file read-only.
	  Utilities that do not need write access to the history now
	  open it read-only, which means that mere mortals may run
	  programs such as dilookup and didump.

2001-11-14
	* dreaderd: Add a dreader.access "access" option to specify a
	  Berkeley DB file to verify the client IP.

2001-11-09
	* dreaderd: Allow the reader welcome banner (with format options)
	  to be configured per vserver.

2001-11-07
	* diablo: Change to a news article storage format. Each article
	  is now stored with a binary header. This change also includes
	  wireformat storage (enabled with diablo.config option) and
	  is backward compatable with old spools.
	  NOTE: You cannot use old versions of diablo with spools
	  created in the new format.

2001-11-03
	* diablo: Add diablo.config option 'feedermaxartsize' to limit
	  the size of articles accepted on incoming feeds. This can
	  be used to prevent extremely large articles creating huge
	  memory buffers.

2001-10-31
	* diablo/dreaderd: Expanded the ranged 'feedhash' option to
	  reader spool fetches and feeder metaspools.

2001-10-31
	* diablo: Add an option 'feederbuffersize' to set the starting
	  incoming article buffer size.

2001-10-30

	  outbound feeds by specifying ranges.

2001-10-25
	* all: Add the ability to view/change most diablo.config values
	  at runtime via "dicmd/drcmd config".

2001-10-25
	* dicmd/drcmd: If multiple command-line parameters are used,
	  then make them all part of the same command, rather than
	  split them into multiple commands. Multiple commands can
	  be fed in by stdin.

2001-10-25
	* dreaderd: Add a dserver.hosts option to split article fetches
	  across spools based on the hash as used in the 'hashfeed' option
	  in dnewsfeeds.

2001-10-24
	* diablo: Add 'feedhash' option to dnewsfeeds so that a
	  feed can be split across multiple labels with no duplicates,
	  based on a simple hash of the Message-ID.

2001-10-22
	* dreaderd: An a compile-time option to enable auto-ban lists
	  for abusive clients trying to connect beyond their configured
	  access limits.

2001-10-16
	* dreaderd: Increase the max number of cached header files
	  to equal the number of threads per process.

2001-10-16
	* diablo/dnewslink: Add 'host' option and 'flush' option to
	  'realtime' in dnewsfeeds to simplify configuration files.
	
2001-10-13
	* diablo/dnewslink: Add a new dnewsfeeds option 'notify' to
	  cause dnewslink to "register" with the master diablo process
	  feed notification system. The feed notification system allows
	  the master process to notify a dnewslink when there is an
	  article that needs to be fed. When used with the realtime and
	  rtflush options, this causes a significant reduction in article
	  relay latency at the expense of higher file descriptor usage.

2001-10-13
	* all: Add a new '~/run' directory where unix domain sockets
	  are created.

2001-10-11
	* dreaderd:post.c: If a user realm authenticated as the address
	  they are trying to post as, allow it, regardless of ckaddress. 
	  This allows correct behaviour in all cases for realm auth users
	  attempting to do this who might otherwise be blocked by ckaddress.

2001-09-30
	* diablo: Add new dicmd "dumpfeed [LABEL]" to dump the details
	  of the in-memory version of dnewsfeeds.

2001-09-27
	* dreaderd: Add a 'db' auth method for Berkeley DB databases.
	  The database can also (optionally) return a readerdef.

2001-09-25
	* dreaderd: Allow NNTP-Posting-Date: header to be GMT or
	  localtime (compile-time option).
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2001-09-24
	* dprimehostcache: Now requires an option to be specified otherwise
	  prints a usage message.

2001-09-17
	* dreaderd: Add an option 'localspool' to specify the location
	  of a local diablo spool where articles will be retrieved
	  after lookup via the WHEREIS NNTP extension.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2001-09-17
	* diablo: Add a command 'whereis' to allow a connecting server to
	  find the location of an article on the spool (useful for NFS
	  mounted spools). This needs to be enabled per incoming feed.
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2001-09-17
	* diablo: Fix closing of compressed spool files.

2001-09-17
	* dexpire: Add a per spool object option (minfreefiles) to
	  specify the minimum free files (inodes) on a file system.
	  dexpire will delete old article files until this minimum
	  is reached.

2001-09-14
	* doverctl: Add an option to copy files across filesystems

2001-09-14
	* dexpireover: Handle header db directories structures with
	  symlinks correctly.

2001-09-11
	* diablo: Add "spamalias" option to dnewsfeeds for preventing
	  propogation of articles based on the last 2 entries of the
	  Path: header.
	  Submitted by: uhclem @ nemesis.lonestar.org (Frank Durda IV)

2001-09-11
	* diablo: Add (optional) support for using the
	  X-Original-NNTP-Posting-Host: header for the spamfilter.
	  Submitted by: uhclem @ nemesis.lonestar.org (Frank Durda IV)

2001-09-05
	* dreaderd: Add an option to dserver.hosts to specify which server
	  will handle articles for specific groups/hierarchies when
	  articles are fetched by article number (not by Message-ID).
	  Also fix the round-robin server requests.

2001-08-30
	* dreaderd/netremote: The code to correctly accept a readerdef
	  from the remote server was apparently never fully commited.
	  Fixed.

2001-08-30
	* dreaderd: Add an option 'readergrouphash' to diablo.config to
	  allow different header file and directory structures. This adds
	  the functionality to have multiple levels of directories and
	  to use different hash methods for the header DB.

2001-08-29
	* diablo: Allow the different internal spamfilter types to be
	  set differently in diablo.config.

2001-08-02
	* dexpireover: Make the actual expire process conditional
	  on an option (-y) and running with no options prints
	  a usage message.

2001-07-06
	* dreaderd: Add a compile-time option to enable client CPU
	  use timing. Submitted by: michael @ freenet-ag.de

2001-06-08
	* dreaderd: Add support for passing session statistics back to
	  an authentication method via the DNS resolver task.

	  Caveat: this isn't supported for most auth methods, and only
	  makes sense in the context of something like an external SQL
	  or other database of some type which is used to control user
	  access - for example, allowed-bytes-per-day.

	  Caveat^2: Even the NetRemote support is sketchy as of right
	  now.  Some additional work is required to pretty this up.
	  dreaderd needs to record the authenticator for a given
	  user so that it can be called back with the correct
	  authenticator and options.

	* NetRemote: Add support for processing the above.

	* dnewslink: Report sliding average pending articles per site
	  Submitted by: michael @ freenet-ag.de

2001-05-25
	* dfeedtest: Add a new utility to test which dnewsfeeds labels match
	  an article

2001-05-16
	* dreaderd: Add PAM authentication method
	  Submitted by: Francois Petillon <fantec @ proxad.net>

2001-05-08
	* diablo: Add support for compressed newsfeeds based on the old
	  patch by Christopher M Sedore. See dnewsfeeds for a description
	  of the 'compress' option.

2001-05-04
	* dreaderd/netremote: Incompatible protocol change.  netremote will now
	  support specific readerdef responses, and allow for some future stuff
	  we have not written just yet.  If anyone else is using netremote, let
	  me know so I may continue hacking on it without totally breaking you

	  dnewslink to stat() every article file before offering
	  the article.

2001-07-10
	* dspoolout: Add 'queueskip' option to dnewsfeeds to make
	  dspoolout/dnewslink not process the N most recent queue files

	* diablo: Don't break groupdef linked list when adding the
	  GLOBAL label in dnewsfeeds.
	  
2001-07-07
	* dreaderd: Add compile-time option (lib/vendor.h) to force
	  adding an NNTP-Posting-Date header.

2001-06-06
	* dreaderd: Don't add extra \r at the end of Xref: and Path:
	  lines when retrieving an article from the spool

2001-05-29
	* dreaderd: Log the vserver for connect and reject messages

2001-05-25

	* dexpire: Fix a bug causing valid articles to be expired when
	  the %s option is used in a spool path.

	* dreaderd: Add options to dserver.hosts to set local bind interface
	  and tx/rx buffer sizes. Prompted by a patch from: George Cox
	  <gjvc @ sophos.com>.

	* dreaderd: Limit what commands are valid between a client using
	  AUTHINFO USER and AUTHINFO PASS.

	* dnewslink: Fix some performance problems due to excessive
	  use of fcntl().

	* dexpire: Fix off-by-one error in memory allocation, patch
	  from Gabor Gombas.

	* dreaderd: Add an option to disable detailed reader logging.

	* diablo: Add "dumphist" command to dicmd.  Asks the parent diablo
	  process to call the configured dumphist program in a blocking 
	  manner.  New connections are not accepted and articles are not
	  written to history for the duration of the program run.  This is
	  intended to help those with memory filesystems for history make 
	  periodic history file snapshots without a lot of extra pausing 
	  and scripting.

Diablo 3.0-REL
	* pgpverify: Add a HOME env variable before executing pgp. HOME
	  is set to 'path_home' in diablo.config.

	* diablo: Use zalloc for diab-filter, and free memory when
	  forking from the parent.

	* diablo: Add 'rejectarts' and 'dontstore' options to metaspool
	  definitions. This removes the 'unwanted' option.

	* didump: Fix recently intoruced bug that caused old articles
	  to be incorrectly removed from history

	* diablo: If a newsfeed label has a '/', try to create the
	  directories it requires, rather than fail silently.

	* dreaderd: Add an option to disable Newsgroups: header verification
	  for POST requests.

	* dlockhistory: Experimental new daemon to mlock the history hash
	  table into memory for a possible performance win on low memory
	  machines.

	* dexpireover: Fix the lock timeout mechanism.

	* dreaderd: Allow '()<>' as characters in group descriptions

	* diablo: Fix a bug which would log the wrong number of seconds
	  in the first checkpoint message.

	* diablo: Add the ability to execute a program upon normal server
	  termination.  This is potentially handy for any number of cleanup
	  tasks.  path_shutdown_cleanup in diablo.config.

	* dreaderd: Add a vserver option 'noreadpath' to disable the
	  addition of a Path: entry for this reader. Useful for a cache-only
	  dreaderd that only has other dreaderd's as clients.

	* diablo/dreaderd/dstart: Syncronised the bind and port options
	  to '-B bindip[:port]' and '-P [bindip:]port' for all programs.
	  Add diablo.config options for bind address.

	* dspoolout: Add a priority option so that some feeds can be
	  given higher priority (nice value) than others.

	* dexpire: More fixes for the /news/spool/news special case.

	* lib/spool: Fix spooldirs when using them on /news/spool/news.

	* dspoolout: Properly preserve flags across passes; otherwise the
	  realtime dnewslink processes can be forgotten.

	* diloadfromspool: Better support for spool object scanning and add
	  an option to 'unexpire' articles.

	* diablo: Cleanup the expire flag in history. It is now a single
	  bit of the h.exp entry so we maintain the old info on the article.
	  This should also be backwardly compatable with existing history
	  files, but new history files won't work with older code. 

	* dreaderd: Add an interim patch to handle group name hash conflicts.
	  This appears to work and I will maintain support for transparent
	  upgrading to better code later. Once dexpireover is run, the
	  header database can no longer be accessed by older code, although
	  this code can handle older databases. Conflict resolution is done
	  by storing the group name into the overview index header and
	  an iteration number into dactive.kp for subsequent conflicts.

	* doutq, contrib/feeder-stats: Add support for dnntpspool.ctl-less
	  operation.

	* dexpire: Fix a bug which would expire all articles in new-style
	  spools on every invocation, if they were under /news/spool/news.

	* dexpireover: Fix a race condition that was causing dexpireover
	  to resize groups with the incorrect end article number. This
	  should fix the "missing articles" problem reported by many and
	  the "corrupted overview entry" error logged occasionally.

	* diablo: Allow incoming hostnames to be specified in dnewsfeeds
	  as 'inhost' per label.

	* diablo: Add an experimental spool compression option. This can
	  be enabled per spool object. See lib/vendor.h for details.

	* diablo: Add path_pathlog option to diablo.config to enable logging
	  of Path: lines - useful for inpaths stats. Also allows Path: to
	  be piped to an external program.

	* diablo/dnewslink: Flush the open file cache every 10 minutes to
	  allow spool files to be deleted if necessary.

	* diablo: Set default metaspool reallocinterval to 10 minutes

	* diablo/dnewslink: Keep some realtime, persistant statistics for all
	  incoming, outgoing and spool feeds that can be dumped with
	  dfeedinfo. This can be tuned with 'feederrtstats' in diablo.config.
	  IMPORTANT NOTE: This changes the format of diablo incoming feed
	  syslog lines

	* diablo/dreader: Add options to diablo.config to allow auto
	  creation of newsgroups if they don't exist

	* dgrpctl: Add an adjust command to adjust NB, NE and NX values

	* dsyncgroups: Add -P option to specify a % limit increase in the
	  end article number

	* dreaderd: Audit responses from spool servers during POST cmd

	* dreaderd: Correctly initialise the authentication structures.
	  This fixes a bug that stopped the group restrictions for
	  list active.

	* dreaderd: Add option ignoreauthinfo to readerdef to ignore AUTHINFO
	  from clients that match an IP range

	* diablo: Hopefully fixed a bug with history corruption when
	  rejecting articles, due to a buffer not being flushed properly

	* dspoolout: Add 'r' option to force starting a realtime process
	  if one is configured. Also increase the chance of starting
	  a realtime process when there is a small backlog

	* dreaderd: Add a path_drincominglog to log incoming feed
	  articles into a separate file or syslog

	* dreaderd: Use -X option to specify an Xref: hostname when
	  we are generating Xref: lines

	* dclient: New program to run commands on remote server and put
	  output to stdout

	* dsyncgroups: Optimise by only updating fields when there are
	  changes to them. Allow the group flag to be specified.

	* dgrpctl: Add listnewsgroups and groupinfo commands
 
	* all: Add '-V' option to all binaries to print version and exit

	* dsyncgroups: Add verbose and notforreal options. Improve usage
	  message

	* diablo/dnewslink: Use double type for bytes counters

	* diablo: Log article size and type when rejecting an article.
	  This changes the format of the reject log line in the incoming log

	* dgrpctl: Add a 'listactive'

	* diablo: Log the number of stat/article/head/body/bytes for
	  articles retrieved from the spool, when the connection closes

	* diablo: Add the ability to allocate all articles received
	  from a specific host to a metaspool

	* diablo: External spamfilter now compiled in by default and
	  the path is specified in diablo.config

	* dexpire: Add an option so that we calculate directory
	  sizes and use these sizes to determine space free rather
	  than doing a statfs() after each delete. Dexpire will run
	  until all requirements are met unless the '-O' option is
	  used. Also do all size calculations in bytes.

	* dexpire: Properly close fd's when computing spool size,
	  other bugs in spool size calculations.

	* diablo/dreaderd: Add diablo.config options for most command-line
	  opts. Use a structure to handle all global options.

	* dreaderd: Allow post and list group restictions to be defined
	  separately from group access restrictions.

	* dstart: Add a new program that does the root user stuff and
	  switches to the news user before executing diablo/dreaderd

	* diablo: Add a rudimentry incoming filter that allows incoming
	  articles to be rejected by article type before they are
	  saved to disk (IFILTER in dnewsfeeds) - needs expansion, but
	  this works for now

	* feeder-stats: Prevent some dib by zero errors

	* diablo: Add dicmd command 'rawstats' for unformatted stats

	* diablo: Add '-X' option to allow the Xref: hostname to be
	  specified separately from pathhost if Xref: generation is enabled.
	  Submitted by: Cor Bosman < cor @ xs4all.net >

	* dreaderd: Add an option to dreader.access that allows the
	  access matching to stop at a particular access line if matched

	* dreaderd: Add a hook for a local C filter for outbound posts.
	  A really annoying spammer deserves an equally annoying revenge.

	* dnewsfeeds: Properly load up values from the GLOBAL
	  label (this code should be thrown out and re-written.)

	* diablo: General spamfilter changes:
	    - internal filter disabled by default (enable with -S)
	    - internal posting-host filter disabled by default
	    - internal and external filters configurable as
	      newsfeed entries (ISPAM and ESPAM). This gives
	      control over what gets sent to the filters.

	* dnewsfeeds: Disable caching for feed data retrieval,
	  since otherwise we end up using the same feed entry
	  for every feed.

	* doutq: Support the new dnewsfeeds file format, if no
	  dnntpspool.ctl exists.

	* diablo: Add code to categorise articles based on their
	  type (e.g: binaries, mime, etc). This type can them be
	  used to filter articles for feeds or spool objects.
	  See samples/dnewsfeeds for article types.

	* dreaderd: Allow the authenticators to return a string that
	  can include a readerdef to use once authenticated. Only
	  the file authentication method uses it so far.

	* dnewsfeeds: Add a whole bunch of new options that are used
	  by dspoolout. Replaces the options used in dnntpspool.ctl.

	* dspoolout: dnntpspool.ctl is redundant. All options are specified
	  in dnewsfeeds under the corresponding label. The old file
	  will still be used if it exists, in which case dnewsfeeds
	  won't be used for dspoolout options.

	* dreadover: Add -a option to display MaxArts for all groups
	  in active file.

	* all: Expand the spool system quite significantly to allow
	  the allocation of hierarchies to spool objects. dexpire.ctl
	  is now only used by dreaderd/dexpireover and diablo/dexpire
	  now makes use of a new file: dspool.ctl. See samples/dspool.ctl)
	  for the format of the file and how to use it. The major
	  differences from previous version:
		- addition of dspool.ctl
		- spooldirs option in diablo.config is now in dspool.ctl
		  and per spool object (kept for compatability mostly and
		  the ability use very large spool objects with a large
		  number of spool directories).
		- No longer use 'expire reader/feeder' in diablo.config
		  and hence no more slot based expire - this can be handled
		  with multiple metaspools (almost) making it much more
		  flexible.
		- diablo no longer uses dexpire.ctl, although the old format
		  of that file is parsed correctly by dreaderd/dexpireover.
		- the history file is not updated by dexpire unless a
		  spool directory is removed. Updates can be forced with
		  the '-h' option.

	* dreaderd: Add some basic LDAP user/pass authentication. Needs to be
	  enabled at compile-time - see lib/vendor.h

	* diablo/dreaderd: Add option to create active file entry for all
	  newsgroups seen.  Groups created in this manner will not have a
	  description, and moderated groups won't be set up correctly.
	  Intended for use in conjunction with external mechanisms to
	  address these issues.

	* dsyncgroups: Allow input from a file

	* dreaderd: Implement NEWNEWS - defaults to disabled, but can
	  be enabled with an option in dreader.access

	* contrib: A little utility to assist with those who have the
	  need to change their spooldirs directive in diablo.config.  It
	  will provide information about what spool data needs to be moved
	  to generate a working config.

	* dreaderd: Add new authentication type, NetRemote, to allow for
	  remote centralized authentication over the 'net.  Includes a
	  sample auth mini-server with all the networking stuff but no
	  actual authentication guts (you can build your own).  UTSL
	  documentation provided.

	* dreaderd: Add new drcmd 'stats' and 'rawstats' commands to
	  display various stats and improve syslog logging of some stats.
	  'rawstats' is used to display the stats in a format useful
	  for stats gathering tools.

	* dsyncgroups: Add -n option to specify an increment applied to
	  the NX and NE fields when they are synced.

	* drequeue: Add -s (send to stdout) option and ability to specify
	  a newsfeed label on command-line

	* dreaderd: Log time connected

	* dreadart: Allow didump output line in '-f -' mode to bypass
	  history lookup

	* diablo: Improved incoming article error detection

	* diablo: Don't mmap article when doing HistoryLookup for STAT

	* diablo/dreaderd: Synchronise the -B option for binding to an IP

	* diablo: Use the command-line -c and -p order to determine the
	  order the entries are added to the Path:. Allow multiple of
	  both -c and -p options.

	* dreaderd: Add the beginnings of some spool server article and
	  byte count logging.

	  Patch from: "Michael O'Reilly" < Michael.O'Reilly @ cwo.com.au >

	* dreaderd: Fix a potential buffer overflow when responding to a 
	  successful post.

	* dreaderd: remove '\r' from empty lines of messages posted to a
	  moderator. Submitted by: GOMBAS Gabor < gombasgu @ inf.elte.hu >

	* dexpireover: Don't remove overview files if we get disk errors
	  otherwise we lose the overview data we have

	* didump: Option to verify that each history entry dumped can
	  be found in history via normal HistoryLookup()

	* dspoolout: Add a new option 'maxstream' to dnewsfeeds that
	  specifies the maximum number of articles to offer per
	  streaming transaction.
	  Submitted by: Bolo < bolo @ cs.wisc.edu >

	* diablo: Better handling of articles with tab in Newsgroups header
	  or nul anywhere - articles rejected

	* dnewslink: Performance improvement by not looking for headers
	  in the body of the articles.

	* dnewslink: Add an option to allow the Bytes: header to be
	  ignored on an outgoing feed. Useful for a header-only relay

	* dreaderd: Fix a bug that was rejecting connections that
	  required authentication to do anything

Diablo 2.4-REL
	* dreaderd: When displaying an article from cache, use the
	  header db for the headers so that the Xref article number
	  matches the one requested. This can be disabled with the
	  undocumented spoolheaders option in dreader.access.

	* diablo: Add maxsize and minsize to remotely configurable
	  feed option list

	* dreaderd: Fix a bug where dreaderd would spin and chew up CPU
	  cycles, if the client disconnected abruptly or otherwise kept
	  the SendQ full.

	* dreaderd: Updated post-addr-ck.c to actually do correct sanity
	  checking for TLD's, etc.  The legacy version only allowed US-
	  centric checking.

	* dnewslink: Properly add up bytes for articles sent in streaming
	  mode.

	* dnewslink: Better handling of hung connections
	  Partial patch from: Andrew Gierth < andrew @ erlenstar.demon.co.uk >

	* diablo: Faster response to incoming connections (Andrew Gierth)

	  years supplied by non-Y2K compliant readers.
		Patch (modifed) from: wusel @ uu.org (Kai 'wusel' Siering)

	* dreaderd: Fix bug in byte count for non-headfeed
	  Reported by: wusel @ uu.org (Kai 'wusel' Siering)

	* diablo: When rejecting a bad Message-ID, include the Message-ID
	  that was supplied

	* pgpverify: Support PGP 6.5.i
	  From: michael @ freenet-ag.de

	* diablo: Keep track of bytes accepted and bytes received
	  Requested (and part patch) by: michael @ freenet-ag.de

	* diablo: Better error handling for spool disk full

	* Catch incomplete incoming articles and report error

	* diablo: Fix history corruption when activedrop == yes

	* diablo: Only generate Xref: if a group is in active

	  Fix from: Bolo < bolo @ cs.wisc.edu >

Diablo 2.2-REL

	* Fix bug in article post that caused core dump

Diablo 2.1-REL

	* dprimehostcache: Add '-dump' option to display contents of
	  dhosts.cache.

	* diablo: Fix bug in dns fwd/rev checking that could allow hostname
	  spoofing. Also fix problem with IP lookups for dhosts cache.

	* dreaderd: Report reason for rejecting controls.

	* diablo: Fix Xref: generation for control.* messages to only
	  generate the Xref: for the control group.
	  Steve Wyles < stevew @ ops.netcom.net.uk >

	* dreaderd: Use 400 response when client is allowed to
	  connect again later (timeout, too many users, etc).

	* diablo: Another fix for multiple spool directories

	* dreaderd: Fix post Path: addition to allow no path addition
	  Reported by michael @ freenet-ag.de

	* diablo: Use proper file locking for creating dhosts.cache

	* dexpireover: Add an option '-x' to enable a different expiry
	  method. This new method tries to calculate how many header
	  slots should be available based on the expire time vs the
	  oldest article and how many articles are there already.

	* dexpireover: Add options to dexpire.ctl to allow the minimum
	  and maximum header slot count to be specified.

	* dreaderd: When retrieving headers, stop scanning at the
	  end of the header - control messages are stored whole.

	* dreaderd: Tighten up and improve the access control with new
	  options for IP only matches.

	* diablo: Add back "allow_readonly" option for backward compat
	  (ignore + syslog a notice pointing at dserver.hosts)

	* diablo: Fix handling of single-entry Path headers (from
	  michael @ freenet-ag.de)

	* diablo: Allow '+' in group names in dynamic feed configuration
	  code (from michael @ freenet-ag.de)

	* diablo/dreaderd: unified the rc.news scripts and added some 
	  documentation, you must edit this script before using it (you
	  had to before anyways)

	* diablo: fixed DiabloSpoolDirs import; wrong code was imported

	* diablo: Be more informative in some error messages

	* dreaderd: Fix calculation of ratelimittax

	* diablo: Fix (grr) a code merge error in the DiabloSpoolDirs
	  code in dexpire

	* diablo: Fix the generation of Xref: lines for control.* groups

	* dreaderd: Fix Xref: generation by using ReportedHostName rather
	  than a vserver name.

	* dreaderd: Fix idle/session timeout - it was broken at some stage
	  Also send a 502 response to the client before closing the
	  connection.

	* dreaderd: Add an auth option to allow CDB database lookups
	  Submitted by: Thomas Neumann <tom @ smart.ruhr.de>

	* dreaderd: Allow control messages to be filed in special 
	  "control.*" newsgroups, if those groups exist, as opposed to 
	  just executing and then trashing them.  This allows the admin
	  to see recent newgroup/rmgroups, and possibly cancels if you
	  are into that sort of thing.

	* Don't use a newly created host cache file of zero length
	  (This is a safeguard)

	* Fix a bug with active file caching that caused a core dump

	* Increase usleep time in dnewslink for realtime feeds. 1ms causes
	  performance problems.

Diablo 2.0-REL
	* Updated feeder-stats.pl to latest from Brad with local mods
	  for 2.0

	* Added newsmaster and readercrash options to diablo.config
	  which set the address for control message mail and specify
	  a program to run if dreaderd crashes. (kolya)

	* Only set the NewsAdmin if we didn't use -A to set it and
	  documented the -A option
	  Reported by: Dave Rynne

Diablo 2.0-BETA03
	* Make pre/post commit size and retention times runtime
	  configurable

	* Cleanups and fixes for some of the article reject code
	  in incoming article processing  (Robert Kiessling with
	  some additions from rv)

	* Return a 201 greeting code when the client is not allowed to
	  send articles to us. (kolya)

	* Add 'grouplog' option to readerdefs in dreader.access, which
	  allows disabling logging of group names in dreaderd.status
	  and via syslog. (kolya)

	* Do some basic header checking whilst feeding. i.e: make sure
	  there is one (and only one) of each of the important headers
	  (Robert Kiessling)

	* Add new reject message (TooSmall) for articles below a minimum size
	  to distinguish "really" missing headers from empty articles sent. 
	  (Robert Kiessling)

	* Move CommonPathName to be front of the MISMATCH
	  (reported by Robert Kiessling)

	* Reduce precommit expire time to 30 seconds and increase
	  postcommit to 45 minutes

	* Improve dnewslink logging: logarts now takes a parameter
	  which specifies the log level (Robert Kiessling)

	* Improve the code to handle 431 responses in diablo so that
	  the defer queue gets cleared when it starts filling up
	  (Robert Kiessling)

	* Support for forced read-only incoming connections (dreaderd
	  spool) and "mode readonly" (R flag in dserver.hosts) (kolya)

	* Allow per vserver max connection limiting

	* Add 'drcmd vstats' to display some stats about readerdef
	  and vserver usage

	* Use 436 for 'resend later' in IHAVE

	* Add NEWGROUP caching (kolya)

	* Add an option to allow DNS Fwd/Rev mismatch for an authdef

	* Some more logging patches for dnewslink from Robert Kiessling

	* Allow reuse of requeue queue in dnewslink - this allows
	  realtime processes to flush and reuse it.

	* Close and open the incoming log for child diablo processes

	* Add precomreject option to enable rejecting precommit hits
	  for an incoming feed (Diablo did this pre-2.0)

	* Fix a bug which caused Diablo to bogously accept and spool
	  PostDuplicate articles (Robert Kiessling)

Diablo 2.0-BETA02
	* Go back to using Joe's CidrMatch as it handles more odd cases

	* Hopefully fixed drcmd exit

	* Reduce the default feed forks to 2 - we seldom need more than 1

	* Add a date to the incoming log for diablo feeding

	* Fix various rejctions that would hang around in the precommit
	  cache too long so we lose the opportunity to get the article
	  from another host. Thanks to Robert Kiessling
	  < Robert.Kiessling @ de.easynet.net > for the discussion, hints
	  and some patches.

	* Log history hits, tab in Path: header rejections and duplicate
	  article after receive for incoming feeds

	* Add a %STATS label that accepts a connection, prints some
	  stats and closes the connection

	* Improve the outgoing article logging in dnewslink by also
	  logging the time, stage and reason for rejection.
	  (Robert Kiessling < Robert.Kiessling @ de.easynet.net >)

	* Allow ident user to be specified in the access line of
	  dreader.access

	* Suggest a Message-ID: in the POST response (experimental)

	* Fix the use of some of the vserver options in headers

Diablo 2.0-BETA01
	* Log the group names+counter for readers

	* Add 'version' command for drcmd and dicmd

	* Improved functionality of dreadover

	* Use 502 response codes for failed connects to reader

	* FIX: Stop feed-only processes from making a connection to the
	  backend spool - they don't need it

	* Add a command "dgrpctl" to allow one to add/mod/del newsgroups

	* Use 431 (resend later) when we get a precommit cache hit
	  with incoming articles

	* Add ability to log incoming articles (feeding) to a file
	  instead of only to syslog

	* Add support for drcmd ("drcmd help" to get commands)

	* Add modifyxrefhost to vserver def to allow overriding
	  of Xref: hostname

	* Add an idletimeout and sessiontimeout that can be enabled
	  per reader group.

	* Add an option to nntpspool.ctl to allow restrictions on the
	  hours a feed is allowed to start up.

	* Add -x option to diablo feeder to enable updating of NX
	  field if active is enabled. This is useful for a backup
	  to an Xref master.

	* Allow a max article size to be specified for the external spamfilter

	* Allow dnewslink to handle 'resend later' responses correctly
	  by really resending them later.

	* Complete rewrite of dreader authentication with a new
	  file (dreader.access) in a new format
		- add a delayedclosesecs to delay closing on failure
		- more comprehensive virtual server configuration
		- add group restrictions
		- all authentication now done in dns processes
		- rate limit tax for reducing rate on extra connections

	* Fix bugs in handling of the rebuild of the diablo.hosts
	  cache.

	Transit stuff:

	Enhanced article logging now available via syslog.  Will provide
	information about why an article was rejected, and/or XRef:
	numbering and stuff like that.

	Changed a whole bunch of various session messages to be more
	informative and useful.  Add "-A" flag to command line to set news
	admin contact address.

	XRef: generated for control messages if control.* newsgroups exist.
	Eventually these should be made available at the reader level.

	Diablo SpoolDir modification: allow multiple spool directories so
	that you don't have to build terabyte-sized spool filesystems for
	things like binaries.  The spool directories are simply meant to
	be equally sized "sub-spools", and do not get into gymnastics to
	put particular groups or particular article sizes on particular
	spools.

	Fix history sizing, for those of us who really did mean it when
	we put in "hsize 64m" in diablo.config.

	From kolya: checks for malloc() return values.

	From kolya: SIGALRM patch for dnewslink.c

	Reader stuff:

	Integrated a whole bunch of stuff to provide virtual news reader
	capabilities.  See "vN" flag in dreader.hosts, and dreader.virtuals
	file for configuration details.

	Enhanced system logging now available via syslog.

	Enhanced transaction logging now available via syslog.

	Added per-session byte/article, per-group byte/article counters.

	Changed some session messages to be more informative and useful.
        Add "-A" flag to command line to set news admin contact address.

	Added lots of stuff to outbound post system, see comments in
	vendor.h:

	1) From: address checker (not comprehensive, but good for US ISP's)
	   to prevent things like "sally@fuck.net".  If somebody would care
	   to figure out a way to generalize this...,
	2) Regurgitation checking to prevent users from posting articles
	   that they fetched back at the server,
	3) Forcible Message-ID rewriting,
	4) Restrictions on cancel and supersedes issuing (Hipcrime buster),
	5) Encrypted NNTP-Posting-Host and X-Trace capabilities

	Rewrote DnsTest, and therefore also the entire dreader.hosts
	file format.  Now can do RADIUS, multiple user=/pass=, CIDR
	notation on IP ranges, etc.

	Added realm= optimization to dreader.hosts

	From kolya: overview flushing patch.

	From kolya: dsyncgroups patch.

Diablo V1.28

	* DReaderd can now handle duplicate articles if it is run with the
	  '-x xrefhost' option.

	* Added 'readerxover trackonly' option.  This causes dreaderd to 
	  maintain the xover control files but not the xover data files,
	  allowing dexpireover to be run but not allowing user reader
	  access.  This would be used in a mid-level cache which you are
	  also using to maintain the active file in regards to article
	  expiration.  The idea here is that your leaf reader boxes can then
	  partially synchronize their active files to the active file
	  maintained on the midlevel box.

	* BSDI configuration now uses anonymous mmap and usleep()

	* PATCHES FROM RUSSELL VINCENT:

	 - don't log successful connects as errors - change to LOG_INFO

	 - add ability to match CIDR blocks in dreader.hosts (incl example)
	   This patch is modified from a patch I obtained from a forgotten
	   source (apologies to author). The original patch didn't work in
	   all cases.
	 - add the ability to limit simultaneous hosts for a matching line
	   in dreader.hosts, rather than for a specific host. Also fix some
	   spelling errors
	 - Keep track of the remote port for client connections so that we
	   close the correct connection each time and we log all connection
	   closes. Also log the port, so that we get a separate log entry
	   for multiple connects/closes instead of syslog logging 'last message
	   repeated n times'.

	 - add '-F' command-line option to disable the external spamfilter
	   if it has been compiled in. Include additions to man page.

	 - add 'logarts' to dnntpspool.ctl and '-A' option to dnewslink
	   to allow logging of all article accepts/rejects for a particular
	   host. Logging is done to "~log/feedlog.hostname".

	 - Also accept a response of 201 (readonly access) from a remote
	   server when running dsyncgroups. We only need read access.

	 - Allow an group:art1-art2 range to be specified to dreadover for
	   extracting header data for a range of articles in a group.

	 - add a '-Q' option to diloadfromspool that reads the spool (ignoring
	   history) for all articles and writes the output in a format that
	   is suitable for drequeue (also included as drequeue.c).

	 - An extra program to (usually) requeue articles for all newsfeeds
	   based on specific input. Uses the standard options for specifying
	   an alternative diablo.config file to, for example, only requeue
	   articles for a specific feed. Please feel free to use the usual
	   Diablo copyright for this.

	 - add a command-line option to disable ident lookups in dreaderd

	 - Rewrite the Authenticate() function of diablo so that it does
	   a background IP lookup of all hosts in diablo.config and caches
	   them. It rewrites the file at a (configurable) interval and
	   when diablo.hosts changes. This fixes a problem where a news
	   server has a given hostname, but the PTR for the IP points
	   to a different host (which resolves to the same IP - hence
	   still reasonably secure). i.e: 2 hosts point to same IP and
	   you want to use the host without the reverse mapping.
   
Diablo V1.27

    More bug fixes from Nickolai.

    While running dreaderd, I've found two more things that I think might
    be worth fixing:

 -- The overview FD cache wasn't being flushed for feed-only forks,
    and thus kept certain groups from being properly resized upon
    expire. I've added the appropriate call to FlushOverCache for
    feed-only forks; this is my fault, I forgot about this case in
    my previous patch.

 -- Stale clients were being accumulated (ACTV in dreaderd.status but
    no TCP connection) because a file descriptor which corresponds to
    a closed TCP connection is not considered writeable by select(),
    at least on Solaris 2.6. I've changed the select() loop to poll
    all fd's for read, and close the connection if recv() returns 0.
    I'm not too sure about the efficiency here, but so far it seems
    to be working OK.

    Here are some additional modifications I've made to diablo-1.25-REL,
    and found quite useful in my situation; perhaps you could integrate
    these into the next release, if you think these would be useful to
    others? Some description of what these diffs intend to do:

 -- Parallelizing dexpireover:
        Add an option to make dexpireover fork N times and have each
        fork process 1/Nth of the overview information. This gives a
        noticeable speedup when running dexpireover with -e (history
        based expiration): on our reader Ultra60, we have two 10kRPM
        disks striped together for dhistory + overview (not spool),
        and 'dexpireover -e' takes ~16 hours; doing it in parallel
        with 4 forks cuts the time down to about 6 hours.

        [ As a side note, running dexpireover with -o, using the
          dexpover.dat file generated by dexpire, takes 10 min ]

 -- Generating Lines: headers in headfeed mode:
        Added an option to dspoolout, and a corresponding switch to
        dnewslink, to generate Lines: headers if one is not already
        present, in headfeed mode. Allows always having a meaningful
        line count in overview.

 -- No-initial-response bug in dnewslink:
        If dnewslink connects to a remote server, and doesn't get any
        reply, it hangs forever try to read from the socket. Set the
        KillFd before trying to read initial response from remote.

Diablo V1.26

   	*** FIXED Y2K BUG IN PARSEDATE() FOR 2-DIGIT YEARS ***.  While
	2-digit years are not legal in USENET Date: headers, some sites
	still produce them.  My Y2K handling for 2-digit years is broken,
	I was incorrectly subtracting or adding 50 instead of 100 in my
	calculations in lib/parsedate.c

	4-digit years (the vast majority of USENET postings) work properly.

   Also, a huge patch set by Nickolai Zeldovich <kolya@MIT.EDU> has been
   integrated in:

  XMakefile.inst        Allow installing from a symlinked build tree
  util/dsyncgroups.c    In some cases, group ends up being NULL; check
  util/dspoolout.c      Check return value from malloc()
  filter/diab-filter.c  Suppress error messages which result from missing
                        articles (invalid filename passed)
  dreaderd/control.c    Missing '@' sign in the email address
  util/dexpire.c        (1) Unchecked malloc() return value
                        (2) Part of the larger change below:

  man/dexpire.8         | Support for expiring overview based on a list of
  man/dexpireover.8     | expired article hash values, written by dexpire.
  util/dexpireover.c    | It might be possible to distribute this file to
  lib/config.c          | remote readers for dexpireover to use, although
  lib/global.c          | I haven't tried (hv's might be different in the
  samples/diablo.config | unlikely case of collision).

  dreaderd/group.c      | Periodic flush of overview FD cache, to allow
  dreaderd/reader.c     | dexpireover to clean more groups

  samples/adm/biweekly.atrim    Fix path to dkp; also changed to reflect
                                the features below:

  lib/newsfeed.c        | Support for dhistory-readonly mode, which allows
  util/diablo.c         | the reader to still retrieve articles while the
  samples/dnewsfeeds    | dhistory file is being rebuilt (no posting, of
  samples/adm/*.reader  | course). Also added a user-configurable delay
  samples/adm/          | in the article-read loop to throttle incoming
       biweekly.atrim   | feeds to a certain degree. Uses nanosleep() and
  XMakefile.inc         | thus requires -lposix4 under Solaris.

Diablo V1.25	

	Incorporated patch submitted by Nickolai Zeldovich <kolya@zepa.net>
	which adds the -e option to dexpireover, causing dexpireover to 
	expire based on the article content in the local spool rather then
	by days.

	Fixed up some compilation collisions with libc w/ strlcpy.

	Fixed bug in dsyncgroups - the creation and last-modified time
	stamp for groups already in dactive.kp was being improperly updated.

Diablo V1.24	

	Fixed arts= and bytes= fractional values in log, they were counting
	3.1022M, 3.1023M, 4.000M ... oops.

	Fixed bug in dreaderd xover code, unterminated article ranges 
	( such as '45-' ) were not being parsed properly.

	Fixed bug in handling of -D option to dsyncgroups.

	Added more documentation on the issue of POSTing from a reader back
	to the feeder and having it propogate down properly.

Diablo V1.23-REL	***** RELEASE ****	

	Fix bug in partial read from local socket that could cause the Act
	count to not decrement properly in dreaderd, locking up dreaderd after
	a while.

	Some adjustments for AIX added by request.

Diablo V1.22-REL	***** RELEASE ****	

	Add -f option to dreaderd, which defaults to ON.  This is the
	FastCopy feature.  When dreaderd retrieves an article
	from a remote spool, it normally buffers it completely before
	sending it to the client.  This is so it can transparently 
	restart the request if the spool server dies.  However, this
	rarely happens.

	Now dreaderd will copy the data to the requesting client as it
	receives it.  If the spool server dies prior to starting the body
	of the article dreaderd can still transparently restart the
	request.  If the spool server dies after starting to send the 
	body, the article will be truncated from the point of view of
	the client.

	Use -f0 to turn off this feature.

Diablo V1.21-test05	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE ****	

	Oops, broke 'xover artno' ... it would list the wrong article number.
	Fixed.

Diablo V1.21-test04	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE ****	

	Test for and fix user bogosity when user specifies bad article
	ranges, to prevent infinite loops in the server.

Diablo V1.21-test03	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE ****	

    	Found and fixed bug in dexpireover reported by linux users in
	regards to 'NFS: No free inodes - contact Linus' error.  Turned
	out to be a mmap() that I was forgetting to munmap!  Bug finally
	located by Paul Martin.

Diablo V1.21-test02	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE ****	

	dreaderd main loop polls open descriptors every 5 minutes, workaround
	for linux bug.  Code will also be used to implement idle timeout later.

	Added a little error checking to recvmsg() (should have no realized 
	effect).

	Diablo's X-Trace: generation made to conform more closely to INN-2.x's,
	includes PathHost as first element now and moves the username
	element.  Will probably change the username to a user-id in the next
	release to prevent scanners from deriving email addresses from X-Trace.

	Test for X-PGP-Sig header migrated from group.c to control.c in order
	to centralize authentication tests in preparation for generalizing
	the interface.

	Control/Authentication interface revamped in preparation for 
	librarization of authentication.

	Bug fixed in lib/dkp.c related to seg-faults occuring in dexpireover
	in certain cases.

	TUNING_NOTES file played with.

	Removed altfeed (feeds/ directory) optimizations that caused 
	directives in dnewsfeeds for feeds with feeds/ files to be ignored.

Diablo V1.21-test01	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE ****		23 Oct 1998

	( This release is designated experimental due mainly to the change
	in the implementation of gropudef/groupref in dnewsfeeds.   Sites
	running complex dnewsfeeds files should probably not move to this
	release.  Other sites, including sites running dreaderd, will almost
	certainly want to upgrade ).

	Groups in dnewsfeeds (groupref, groupdef) are now fully recursive and
	ALL DIRECTIVES ARE SUPPORTED IN THE GROUPDEFs.  This should greatly
	reduce the complexity of some site's newsfeeds.  However, the new
	recursion implementation has not been fully tested yet.

	Added feed-only forks to dreaderd, so you can feed dreaderd without
	loading down a reader fork, which would effect other readers using
	that fork due to the load.  See samples/dreader.hosts, 'f' flag.
	feed-only forks so not make connections to the spool/post servers.
	NOTE: the article, group, and head commands may not be issued for 
	'f'eed only connections (i.e. connections without the 'r' flag set).

	Moderated postings that send mail to the moderator were improperly
	passing certain headers to sendmail, such as Path: and To:, which
	would either be improperly executed by sendmail or improperly 
	forwarded by the moderator.

	Seg-fault in diablo fixed: if diablo tries to retrieve an article
	past the end of the spool file (e.g., due to the spool file being 
	truncated in a crash), it seg faulted.  Fixed.

	dilookup now also understands the output from the didump command.
	(e.g. didump | dilookup -s)

	-F option add to dreadart (force read, ignore expired flag)

	dilookup prints 'not found' entries to stdout rather then stderr
	to make piping greps and stuff through it (via -s) easier.

	Fixed bug in dexpire: would improperly expire history adds that
	occured during the dexpire run itself when reader-mode expiration
	was configured.  dexpire now just looks for the existance of the
	proper spool directory rather then the D.xxxxxxxx/B.xxxx file when
	determining whether to expire a history entry.

	Added 'diloadfromspool' utility.  This utility will scan the entire
	spool, a specific set of D.xxxxxxxx directories, or a specific set
	of D.xxxxxxxx/B.xxxx spool files and regenerate the history records for
	the articles it finds.  Currently there is one catch:  In order to
	properly handle 8-bit-clean articles and ensure the robustness of
	the data, the Lines: header must be correct.  Unfortunately, the
	Lines: header is not always correct so the command needs some more
	work (or I need to recalculate Lines: in the feeder).

Diablo V1.20-REL	***** RELEASE ****

	Better Statistics Reporting in Diablo server - now includes breakdown 
	of why articles were accepted or rejected.

	Increased diablo's precommit cache from 8192 to 16384 entries (from
	128K to 256K of shared memory), and increased collision window from
	30 seconds to 2 minutes, and the pre-commit history pre-cache retention
	from 10 minutes to 40 minutes.

	DReaderD now reports statistics on close: number of groups entered
	(group commands), number of articles read (head, article,
	or body commands), and number of bytes sent to client.

	Added -R option dexpireover - causes it to dynamically resize
	the over.* files and completely rewrite the data.* files in
	/news/spool/group.  This allows fine-grain removal of garbarge from
	the overview files at the cost of rewriting every file.  For this
	reason, 'dexpireover -R -a' should only be run once a week.  The
	standard dexpireover should continue to be run daily.  The standard
	dexpireover is much faster, but leaves wasted space inside the
	data.* files.

	Since dexpireover -R is now able to dynamically resize the overview
	indexes, Diablo defaults to creating 512-article indexes rather then
	1024-article indexes.  On a clean start it may take two or three weeks
	for the article indexes for heavily loaded groups to stabilize.

	Added -s option to dexpireover.  The -s option is implied by the -a
	option.  This option will allow dexpireover to dynmically resize the
	index (over.*) files in /news/spool/group but unlike the -R option
	it will not attempt to rewrite the data.* files.  The combination of
	-a (implying -s) run a daily basis and -R run on a weekly basis 
	should keep disk usage in /news/spool/group in-check.  You can further
	refine disk utilization by setting explicit expire times in dexpire.ctl
	(see 'x' option in samples/dexpire.ctl)

	A WEEKLY crontab entry has been added, you need to add an entry in
	your cron to deal with it.  See samples/adm/crontab.sample

	Updated the cron entries and sample crontab in samples/adm to make use
	of the new dpath command.  Also:  dexpire is now run once an hour rather
	then once every four hours, please double-check you crontabs.

 	Allow .\n to terminate an article as well as .\r\n, because
	some dumb newsclients don't pass the CR like they are supposed
	to.  Well, at least dots are supposed to be escaped so this doesn't
	screw up escaping of 8-bit-clean data.

	Add a Distribution: header internally based on distrib.pats if none 
	is specified in the POST or if a blank Distribution: header is
	specified in the POST.

	Added configuration path elements to diablo.config.  You can also
	specify the location of diablo.config in the DIABLO_CONFIG_PATH
	environment variable or by using the '-C diablo.config.path' option 
	with any command.  Baring that, the default location for the 
	config file is /news/diablo.config.

	dreaderd's debug-aid, -C, has been changed to -X so -C can be used
	to specify a different location for the diablo.config file.

Diablo V1.19-REL	***** RELEASE ****

	Implemented Supercedes: processing

	Fixed bug in GMT handling in newnews NNTP command.

	Fixed bug in moderator addressing, wasn't converting dots to
	dashes.

	Major revamping of documentation

	Implemented 'list distrib.pats', implemented 'list distributions'.

Diablo V1.18-REL	***** RELEASE ****

	Fixed compiler error, some compilers don't like dynamic struct
	initialization.

	Fixed '.' escaping bug with POST command.

	POST command now mails the moderator if an unapproved posting is
	sent to a moderated group.  (POST does not yet (should it???) mail
	any To: lines).

	Control messages were generating article number assignments in 
	the Diablo feeder.  Since control messages are out of band, this
	is incorrect and created gaps on the reader.  The feeder no longer
	generates group:artno in the Xref: line for control messages.

	'listgroup' command no longer lists article numbers that do not
	exist in overview (but still may list articles that no longer exist
	in the spools, since checking spool(s) is expensive).

	Dist now includes Iain's feeder-stats-3.80.  NOTE: Iain changed the 
	passed date format from a two to a four digit year.

Diablo V1.17-REL	***** RELEASE ****

	The XMakefile structure has been reorganized somewhat.  Hopefully this
	will not break builds on other platforms.

	The copyright has been changed.  The less restrictive BSD copyright
	is now in effect, with a few modifications.  I call it my
	"screw MickySoft's monopoly" copyright.

	Diablo reader code now checks for guard characters in the overview
	data file for retrieved overview data and logs any corrupt entries
	that it finds.

	Debug code added in test20 removed, diablo now ftruncate()s article
	files properly again when articles fail the standard filters.

	Fixed a bug in xover, xhdr, and other overview-related commands.  In
	certain cases when a range of articles is specified, information 
	pertaining to the last article number in the range will not be output.

	Fixed a bug in the cancel code - it would not cancel the last article
	in a group due to an off-by-one loop test.

	Added Joe Greco's Diablo-filter functionality.  You have to turn it 
	on in lib/vendor.h.  See filter/README.  THIS IS UNTESTED.

	(late addition to release notes: also adjusted POST code to allow
	a lone newline to separate headers from body.  It previously required
	a CR+LF).

Diablo V1.16-test23	***** BETA RELEASE *****

	NOTE!!  The diablo tar file now extracts into a subdirectory
	named diablo-$(VERS)-$(SUBVERS)/ rather then diablo/ !!!

	Feeder-stats-3.71 from Iain Lee integrated.

	contrib/innactive removed (dsyncgroups should be used to
	generate initial dactive.kp files now).

Diablo V1.16-test22	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Oops, fixed a few syntax errors in the test21 codebase.

	Fixed a boundry condition in the KPDB code that could
	cause dsyncgroups to segfault, or dreaderd in some cases
	if you were looking up the last entry in the database.

	Fixed a race condition in the KPDB scanning code that
	would cause 'list active' to return different sizes
	(it was cutting off a portion of the tail of the database
	during the scan because it was not checking for the case
	where the database needs to be resized).

	Fixed 'listgroup' off-by-one error (it wasn't including the
	last article number).  This was causing tin and other readers
	to get confused.

Diablo V1.16-test21	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****
   
	oops, broke 'article <message-id>' retrieval.  bleh.  fixed.

Diablo V1.16-test20	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	removed ftruncate() from diablo server article spooler.  Instead,
	fill would-be-deleted bytes with 0xFF.  This wastes some space
	but is required to debug an article corruption problem that occurs
	with FreeBSD.

	Fixed bug in spool/post statistics, again.

Diablo V1.16-test19	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Added 'newgroups' command support.  Note: it currently scans dactive.kp
	and therefore isn't very efficient yet, so beware!

	Fixed bug in spool/post statistics (in ps output).

	Fixed a ddprintf() in DoPipe that was broken.

	'article artno' command no longer returns success if the overview
	information is intact but the article cannot be found in the spool...
	it now properly returns '430 No such article'.

	bug in 'list active' and 'newgroups' fixed that would cause the list
	to be improperly cut-off (XXX 21 sep 98: actually not quite fixed
	yet -Matt XXX).

	The Diablo server now detects and logs corrupt spool entries 
	(entries with a NUL as the first or last character, or missing the 
	out of band guard-NUL following the article).

Diablo V1.16-test18	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Fixed bug in dnewslink that caused it to continue to scan
	the queue even when it's batch file got ripped out from
	under it, which could result in more dnewslink's running
	the specified by dnntpspool.ctl

	dnewslink now checks for spaces in the message-id.

	samples/adm/daily.dclean updated.  The 'removal of empty D.XXXXXXXX
	directories' code has been removed.  This code interferes with 
	reader-mode expiration by creating holes in the spool directory
	sequence which causes diablo to hit a failsafe.  Symptoms will include
	Diablo not accepting news quickly enough to keep up with a feed.
	UPDATE YOUR DAILY.DCLEAN SCRIPT!!!!!

Diablo V1.16-test17	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Minor source updates to remove compilation warnings.

	Spam filter handles garbaged hash table entries better.

	Fixed bug in new dhistory file add code that could cause lots of 
	appended blocks of zeros, blowing up the history file's size.

	dnewslink now does more strict checking of Message-ID's


Diablo V1.16-test16	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Serious bug in POST code for reader fixed.

	TCP_NODELAY option set in reader, nagle gets in the way too much
	when lots of little transactions are made (i.e. 'group' commands
	by news clients which have large .newsrc files).

	MsgId() code now checks for garbage message-id's such as '<sdfdsf>>'.
	While this sort of thing doesn't blow up Diablo, it can blow up other
	news systems.  (Not quite finished with this yet, need to incorporate
	a patch from Terry to finish it up).

	Solaris config now expects solaris to have snprintf.  Should get
	rid of bogus syslog error messages but otherwise has little
	effect on the code.

Diablo V1.16-test15	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	'activedrop yes' was causing bogus (non-existent) entries to be 
	written to the queue files for articles caught by that filter.

	The Diablo feeder now limits the number of D. spool directories it
	manages.  The default is 14 days (2016 directories).  See 
	samples/diablo.config for the override.  This is because the expire 
	reader mode of operation doesn't appear to stabilize if the number 
	of spool directories is allowed to grow indefinitely.
	
Diablo V1.16-test14	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Added 10 second reverse ident timeout on read.  Some sites would
	connect but would otherwise just hang the reverse ident, causing a 
	DNS processing backlog.

	Changed history file append mechanism.  Diablo now appends a large
	block of zero'd records then allocates out of the block by scanning
	the last N records.  It is reasonably efficient even though we use
	read() to locate an empty record.

	Added '-SD' option to disable the NNTP-Posting-Host: portion of the
	spam filter.

Diablo V1.16-test12	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	dreader.hosts scan changed AGAIN.. sorry.  Ok, now it scans the file
	once checking for matches against the IP address or FQDN from the
	reverse lookup.  Previously it scanned the file checking FQDN's, then
	scanned the file again checking for IP's which could cause a "*"
	wildcard at the end of the file match an FQDN before an IP address
	earlier in the file matched the IP.  It is now much more intuitive.

	'q' flag added for dreaderd.hosts, surpress logging.  Useful when
	you want to get rid of an idiot who connects a lot, and don't want
	to clutter your logs.

	Added 'L' flag - global rate limiting (per connection) to 
	dreader.hosts.  The specification is 'Lnnnn' where nnnn is
	the number of bytes per second the connection is to be limited
	to.  Example: 'L2048' limits the datarate to 2 KBytes/sec.

	madvise() support added for diablo feeder.  XADV_WILLNEED and
	XADV_SEQUENTIAL added to both the feeder and dnewslink.  (On
	FreeBSD systems, XADV_SEQUENTIAL will fault in more pages
	at a time and XADV_WILLNEED will pre-load the page table for
	pages residing in the buffer cache).  This is turned on
	automatically for FreeBSD (people need to submit patches
	for other OS's).

	dnewslink sets TCP_NODELAY to turn off nagle because it could
	cause unnecessary write buffering delays.  We do a good job
	flushing our output properly and it's already a transaction
	oriented protocol, so...

	dnewslink reconnects to the destination for each queue file.  Now
	it tries to reconnect to the *same* destination it succesfully
	connected to previously.  It does not call gethostbyname() again
	unless a connect() fails.  This way if a host has multiple IN A's
	and some don't work, dnewslink will tend to stick to the one that
	does work.  (this problem noticed with sprintlink).

	increased dnewslink's internal write gather buffer from 4K to 8K.

	Added USE_POLL option for dnewslink to use poll().  It's turned on
	automatically for FreeBSD-3.0 or later.  poll() is used to wait
	for new data to be appended to the queue file so dnewslink can read
	it ('realtime' and 'd-1' options in dspoolout.ctl must be specified),
	and poll()/read() is used rather then alarm(Timeout)/read()/alarm(0)
	when waiting for responses from the remote.

	The Diablo feeder code no longer ftruncate()'s spool files for every
	post-write reject (spam cache, article too large, in-transit history
	collision, etc...).  Instead it simply seeks back.  The feeder will
	ftruncate trailing 'garbarge' from a prior post-write reject on the
	descriptor close() only.  Since ftruncate() must typically fsync()
	a file (or at least the file metadata), the new algorithm should save
	disk I/O.

	Added 'readerdns' option to diablo.config

	syslog logging fixed for dreaderd... it was logging the wrong 
	description process identifier.

	debug aid added to dreaderd, -C option - cause SIGSEGV to be caught
	and infinite-loop the process.  Otherwise process just dies without
	a core due to system setuid() security.

	Fixed dreaderd reader crash - was holding KPDB record pointers across
	state changes (where the KPDB might get remapped) for long scans
	(i.e. 'list active').  Changed KPDB ScanFirst/Next to operate on offsets
	rather then pointers.

	Fixed dreaderd.status slot assignment for when a reader process dies
	and is reforked by the parent.

	Added forward DNS lookup to verify reverse.  hostname matching is 
	not considered legal if reverse lookup does not match forward 
	(if you are doing a public server, FQDN:* would disallow mismatched
	reverse/forwards while IP:* would allow them.  Put IP:* after FQDN:*
	to attempt to obtain the fqdn first, but still allow even if the fqdn
	cannot be obtained)

Diablo V1.16-test11	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Added additional errno checks in lib/buffer.c.  

	Fixed ps status line reporting of number of active spooler and poster
	servers.

	Made fixes to record locking when reading data from dactive.kp... there
	were a few race conditions where one process could be parsing a group
	record while another was simultanious making modifications to it.  This
	will hopefully fix a 'bogus group' race that occurs sometimes... don't
	know yet, crossing my fingers.

	Added 'L' and 'l' rate-limiting options to dreaderd.hosts, added 'h'
	option to dreaderd.hosts, set maximum number of connections from host.
	Added 'u' option to dreaderd.hosts, set maximum number of connections
	from user@host (only applies when identd lookups are successful).
	(NOTE: 'l' and 'L' not yet implemented)

	documented user authentication options in dreaderd.hosts

	Fixed wildcard handling in dreaderd.hosts ... you specify that a
	wildcard is to be applied specifically to an IP address or FQDN
	by using the IP: or FQDN: prefix.  Otherwise it will apply to an FQDN
	only if the wildcard does not start with a digit.

	The sample dcontrol.ctl file was broken.  Removed bogus all: entries
	that were droping valid checkgroups messages.

	Added more explicit instructions in README.READER on how to setup pgp.

	Added options for HPUX in lib/config.h, tested w/B.11.00-A.  Added
	errno tests for EAGAIN (previously only checked for EWOULDBLOCK), again
	to support hpux.

Diablo V1.16-test10	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	** Upgrade your xmake to 1.05 before compiling Diablo **

	** Note, new fields added to dactive.kp.  Run 
	   'dexpireover -a -U999' to add new fields.  It is then
	   suggested that you shut everything down and run
	   'dkp -t dactive.kp' to remove all the garbage from
	   the dactive.kp file. **

	Gave the diablo *feeder* side the ability to process header-only
	feeds.  The feeder can process a mix of header-only and full-article
	feeds.  The feeder-side 'article' and 'body' commands will return an
	article-not-found error if an attempt is made to retrieve an article 
	that was originally stored from a header-only feed.  This allows you
	to run a mix of feeds into a diablo feeder frontend in order to
	deal with duplicates, and then pass a header-only feed onto the 
	reader.

	Fixed minor bug in snprintf().. it should cap the return value
	at the size of the buffer.  The bug didn't effect anything and
	neither will the fix.

	dexpire now has a new option, '-s', which is to be used if your
	spool is softupdates-mounted.  The option causes dexpire to 
	sync/sleep/sync/sleep after removing each directory in order for
	statsfs() to be more reasonable.

	Fixed NumPending/NumActive counter error when a dreaderd/DNS
	process dies or gets stuck.

	Added 'activedrop' option to diablo.config .. when 'active on'
	is set, causing the feeder to assign article numbers from the
	dactive.kp file, the feeder normally continues to spool articles
	with no matching groups in dactive.kp.  If activedrop is set,
	the feeder will reject such articles.  

	Note that when running the feeder and reader on the same box, they
	can safely share the same dactive.kp file.  This is because the feeder
	assigns article numbers via the "NX" field rather then the "NE" field.

	option -X[E,X] added to dsyncgroups to allow the NX field to be
	adjusted based on a remote NNTP host.  Works like the -N option.

	The reader no longer creates overview for non-existant groups.

	'b' option lines expire in dexpire.ctl was not working quite as
	advertised.  Changed the math a bit to make it more exponential.

	Add pre-cancel cache to dreader to allow it to process cancels
	for articles that have not yet arrived.  Only pre-cancels are
	entered into the cache, so as long as we get the article a reasonable
	amount of time after receiving the cancel, we will be able to 
	properly detect that it was canceled.  post-article-cancels are already
	handled.

	redid debugging.  If you send a USR1 signal to a diablo process,
	normally a child diablo process, it will syslog a line for each
	received article indicating whether the article was accepted or
	not and, if not, why.  More USR1's can be sent to bump up the
	debug level.  Send a single USR2 to reset the debug level back to 0.

	dexpire's -s option enhanced somewhat.  '-s#' specifies the sleep
	period inbetween sync()'s.  See manual page.

	Added CTS and LMTS fields to dactive.kp ... keep track of when
	a group was created and when a group last received a new article.
	(see also: -O option to dexpireover).  CTS will also eventually
	be used to implement active.times and related NNTP commands.

	Added -O option dexpireover.  When combined with the -w ( wildcard
	specification ) option, dexpireover will delete stale newsgroups.
	See the manual page to dexpireover.

	Added -h0 option to dexpire.  Allow you to expire the spool without
	updating the history file.  Useful in emergencies or in order to
	expire on a tighter scheduler without incuring the history update
	overhead for every dexpire run.

	Fixed bug in feeder where offset/size was being stored in history
	for articles canceled by size, which could cause dreadart to
	attempt to map the (non existant) article.

Diablo V1.16-test9	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Added -v option to didump so you can see generally where articles
	are landing in the D.XXXXXXXX directory tree when using reader-mode
	expiration.

	changed dexpire again to do a sync();sleep(1);sync(); after each
	directory has been removed, again to try to support softupdates.

	Fixed listen code when max number of Dns or max number of readers
	reached, was previously setting or clearing select bits for all
	descriptors rather then just the descriptors used to listen for new
	connections.

	Dummy 'control.CTLNAME' group added prior to the creation of the
	spool file in Diablo, allowing special expirations to be set for
	control messages.  The sample dexpire.ctl defaults to a nominal 80%
	retention for control.* but only 20% for control.cancel (applies to
	diablo's reader expiration mode).

Diablo V1.16-test8	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	There is an IHAVE protocol case that the feeder handles incorrectly.
	In the case where the remote sends an IHAVE command and gets a 335
	response, and then sends the article, it is expecting a final ack
	of 500, 501, 502, 436, 400, 235, or 437.  It is not expecting a
	435 response for the final ack at this point in the protocol and
	Diablo may send a 435 if an in-transit article collision occurs.
	Diablo has been changed to return a '437 Duplicate.' in this case
	rather then 435.  This only effects the IHAVE protocol, not the
	streaming protocols.  It should be noted that innxmit will handle 
	the 435 response just fine, though not 100% efficiently, and
	newer innfeed's seem to handle a 435 response fine as well, but
	older innfeed's cannot handle it.  While we lose some accuracy by
	reporting the reject code instead of the duplicate code, it's not
	critical in regards to the non-streaming IHAVE protocol.

	Added -l option to didump (line mode flush on output, useful when
	piping didump -f to something (see didump man page).

	dexpire calls sync() and sleep(1) before calling statfs(), so
	decoupled filesystems such as FreeBSD/BSDI w/ softupdates return
	more accurate statfs() results.  Without it, as much as 80% of 
	a 40G spool might be removed before the FS bitmaps catch up.  Oops!

	fixed segfault bugs in dnewsfeed relating to seg faulting on unexpected
	EOF.


Diablo V1.16-test7	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Fixed serious bug on Diablo feeder side.  When operating in
	'expire reader' mode, diablo expects /news/spool/news/D.XXXXXXXX
	directories for each ten-minute period.  dexpire must expire the
	directories in time order and, indeed, it does.  But if diablo
	is killed and restarted, a gap may occur.  Diablo hits a sleep
	failsafe whenever it can't create an article file which can cause
	it to slow down massively.  The fix is to have diablo create any
	missing directories on startup.  I also create missing directories
	at run-time in Diablo locks up for a long enough period of time 
	(which shouldn't happen, but if it does it will log it).  Note that
	it is very important for Diablo to *not* recreate directories that
	have been deleted by dexpire.  Doing so would result in article
	corruption by causing previously deleted article files to be 
	recreated.  Under no circumstances should you ever manually
	rm -rf a spool directory in the middle of the sequence range of
	current spool directories!!!  Use dexpire.

	Added USE_MADVISE option to lib/config.h (and turned it on for
	FreeBSD) -- use madvise() syscall to reduce page faults by pre-mapping
	system-cached pages for articles.  On systems which support it,
	this should reduce page faults taken by dnewslink mmaps which can be
	considerable.  The reader code also uses this when mapping overview
	files.

	dnewslink process title changed so systems with ps status line support
	can see the run-time status of various dnewslinks.

Diablo V1.16-test6	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	Removed dactive.kp cleanup in samples/adm/biweekly.atrim ... this
	will blow up the reader!  Removed manual references to the 'egrep'
	method of pruning a KP database.

	Fixed NumActive accounting.  The reader processes were doing 
	reader accounting for server failures, not just reader disconnects.

	Fixed POST bug. .. oops, I wasn't checking to see if posting was
	allowed and was always allowing posting.  Bleh.

Diablo V1.16-test5	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	'x' option added to dexpire.ctl, see sample file for more info
	(as related dexpireover).

	'b' option added to dexpire.ctl ... adjusts expiration based on
	the number of lines in the article, ala the Lines: header if it
	exists.  (I can't do it based on size because I create the data
	file before I know how large the article will be, and I refuse to
	do a file copy).

	Solaris patches for file descriptor passing added, from
	Kjetil Torgrim Homme and Russell Vincent.

	'Distribution' control patch, from Lars added but with some routines
	rewritten.  Any article without a distribution header is assumed
	to be a distribution of 'world' for purposes of feeding.  See 
	samples/dnewsfeeds for more information.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED
	AND MAY NOT WORK YET.

	Fixed server tracking bugs for dserver.hosts and dreaders.host that
	prevented proper shutdown of reader daemons when parent dies.  Same
	bugs also prevented server reconnects from occuring after a failure.

	Fixed bug in lib/kpdb.c that caused dsyncgroups to segfault.

	Fixed bug in dreaderd mbuf processing.

	IP wildcards in dreader.hosts are treated in a special fashion.  If
	a host name in dreader.hosts starts with a number, it is assumed to
	be an IP address and the wildcard compares are only run against IP
	addresses, not the FQDN from the reverse lookup.  Otherwise something
	like "10.0.0.*" would match "10.0.0.hackers.domain.com".

	README.READER has better instructions now.  Added new directory,
	sample_reader, with example dreaderd + diablo config.

	xmake install will try to install the sample files as softlinks but
	will not overwrite any custom mods you make.  xmake uninstall will
	attempt to deinstall everything, as long as it matches the source
	tree (i.e. will not delete files which you modify).

	Changed 'fgrep -h ... files'  to 'cat files | fgrep ...' in XMakefile's,
	some machines *still* use 15 year old fgrep's.  Sheesh.

	Implemented spool priority mechanism, see samples/dserver.hosts, and
	implemented a spool-latency-history mechanism to automatically handle
	downed servers.

	Fixed bug in xover output .. Xref: header name wasn't being printed
	and it was prefixing each entry with a space, which messes up trn's
	threading.

	Changed diablo's dnewslink -H (i.e. header-only feed) mechanism 
	to include Bytes; header.  Changed dreaderd's input mechanism to
	require a Bytes: header for header-only feeds.  This header is not
	required for normal feeds because it can calculate the article 
	size.  Why all this?  So I can produce the proper Bytes field in
	xover data output.

	Fixed line-too-long buffer overflow bug in diablo.c ( bug found
	by KIZU takashi ).

	Changed while(accept(..) >= 0) to if (accept(..) >= 0) in unix domain
	command socket code to work around a problem with very old SunOS
	releases that do not understand non-blocking accept()'s.

	/news/log/dreaderd.status increased to 120 columns, 70 wasn't enough
	to store readable realtime status.

Diablo V1.16-test4	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	sin_family not set for certain conditions in dreaderd and diablo,
	causing problems with AIX (besides which it really needs to be
	set anyway to be proper).

Diablo V1.16-test3	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	*** NOTICE *** ALL RELEASES AFTER AND INCLUDING 1.14, READ THE 
	DEXPIRE.CTL DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY AND REWRITE YOUR DEXPIRE.CTL
	AS APPROPRIATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
	Fixed pagealloc() & pagefree() code in lib/alloc.c to handle
	0-byte allocations (it needs some more work).

Diablo V1.16-test2	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****

	HAVE_SNPRINTF cleaned up.  It's just too important so the code now
	assumes it exists and we have a fudge routine if it doesn't.  You
	may have to fix HAVE_SNPRINTF in lib/config.h for your OS if you get
	compilation warnings.

	Fixed GetAuthUser() code in dreaderd.. SIGPIPE was not being handled
	properly.
	
Diablo V1.16-test1	***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****
			(continuing NNTP reader development)

	den->d_namlen replaced with strlen(den->d_name), d_namlen does not
	appear to exist under linux or solaris, they use d_reclen instead.

	Didn't include <termios.h> in dreaderd/main.c if NEED_TERMIOS is 
	set.  Messed up solaris compile.

	bcopy in lib/psstat.c if HAVE_SNPRINTF is not set used bad variable
	name (undefined symbol error).  Fixed.  

Diablo V1.15		***** EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE *****
			-- NOTE: basic reader support added

	*** NOTICE *** ALL RELEASES AFTER AND INCLUDING 1.14, READ THE 
	DEXPIRE.CTL DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY AND REWRITE YOUR DEXPIRE.CTL
	AS APPROPRIATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	-H option added to dnewslink for header-only feed, 'mode headfeed' 
	must be supported by server (as a safety feature to prevent a 
	header-only feed from leaking).

	'headfeed' option added to dnntpspool.ctl, used to feed diablo reader
	side.  Sometimes coupled with Xref: for slave synchronization, or the
	reader can operate in a standalone fashion.  For alpha-testing, do
	not use Xref: (you probably aren't anyway).  Diablo's headfeed
	still sends the entire article body for control messages.

   **	ALPHA-TEST DIABLO READER SUPPORT in this release via 'dreaderd',
   **	see manual page for dreaderd.  See README.READER

	New TUNING_NOTES for FreeBSD (may apply to other OS's too) in
	regards to the v_cache_min sysctl.

	The diablo and dnewslink binaries are now statically linked.
	Say what?  Reason is simple:  DLL eats more memory then it saves
	when you are running lots of copies of the same program.  you loose
	pages to the dynamic linking (which prevents them from being shared),
	to the separate data areas, and to the MMU for the mmap.  All told it
	appears comes to around 80K per process.  With statically linked 
	binaries the text areas are 100% shared, there is no MMU overhead
	for the DLL mmap()s, and the data/bss is packed.

    **	The default hash mode is now crc rather then crc/prime, see
	diablo.config for a description.

	Spaces no longer tolerated inside message-id's.

Diablo V1.14		-- NOTE: remove /news/dexpire.factor if it exists
			-- NOTE: /news/dexpire.ctl must be reorganized a bit
			-- NOTE: new REQUIRED configuration file added

	*NOTE* NO reader support yet, but I'm getting close. 

	Added general key-token-value database support and added preliminary
	active file support through the key-token-value database.  This is 
	good enough to allow diablo to generate Xref: headers.  However, no
	control message support has been added yet (that's going to be 
	a reader-side function).  The dactive file is implemented as a 
	shared binary key-token-pair database and is intended to (optionally) 
	hold additional information such as the moderator email, newsgroup 
	description, and control PGP keys.  The format is extensible.  While 
	the dactive file is human readable, it should never be edited manually
	while diablo-related processes are active.  Use the supplied utilities
	instead. THIS SUPPORT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED
	PRODUCTION YET.

	New configuration file, diablo.config added.  See the sample 
	diablo.config file.  This file is REQUIRED.  Diablo will refuse
	to start if this file is missing.

	All entries in diablo.hosts are REQUIRED to have a label, and that
	label is REQUIRED to exist in the dnewsfeeds file.  Diablo will now
	generate a 502 if a label is missing.  Note that you can direct
	incoming-only feeds to the same label if you wish.

	DEXPIRE.CTL works again.  In prior releases dexpire.ctl served only
	to reject articles that were too large.  The spool storage & expiration
	scheme has been redone in this release so time-grouped expires work
	again, allowing you to control expiration based on group.  Note
	that the expiration does not currently work for the control.* pseudo
	group, but it will in a future release.   There is a cost though:
	while the number of physical files is not expected to increase, the
	number of open file descriptors will multiply by about 6x if you use
	the feature.

	The new reader-mode expiration code is NOT turned on by default 
	because I do not want to trip people up.  Please review the top of
	samples/diablo.config to see how to turn it on.

	The system-wide or max-per-user file descriptor limit should be at 
	least 4096 to accomodate an increase in the number of open 
	descriptors if you configure expiration for reader operation.

	The remember time, in days, may be set in diablo.config rather then
	hacking lib/vendor.h if you wish.  This allows many diablo 
	installations to compile straight out of the box without having to 
	edit lib/vendor.h.

	The new CRC64 algorithm can be used for the hash.  The sample 
	diablo.config includes a 'hash' algorithm specification.  The older
	hash algorithm is called 'prime'.  The new one is called 'crc'.  The
	sample diablo.config uses 'crc/prime' which means to use crc, but
	to fallback to prime on lookup if it fails to find a record with crc.
	To avoid blowing your history, you should leave the method set to
	crc/prime for about a week and then set it to just crc.

	DIABLO.HOSTS check made more sophisticated.  Please read the 
	description in the diablo-files manual page for diablo.hosts.
	Diablo will now attempt to match up the base domain of a reverse
	lookup against specific hosts in diablo.hosts if the normal
	reverse+forward lookup security fails, then it will perform a 
	forward lookup of the matching host(s) in diablo.hosts to attempt 
	to match the IP.

	While the new spool setup is backwards compatible to the previous
	setup, more care must be taken when removing spool directories to
	prevent corruption.  If you remove spool directories manually and
	the diablo server is running, you must rename the directory prior
	to rm -rf'ing it to be 100% safe.  The new dexpire does this, of
	course.

	DEXPIRE.CTL now uses a percentage expire.  That is, you specify
	a percentage of the best case expire (1-100) that you wish
	and diablo expires articles accordingly.  See the samples/dexpire.ctl
	file.  Diablo will dynamically and automatically conform itself
	to your expiration parameters but you must edit the file with the
	new scheme in mind for it to make sense.

	Added new utility, dreadart, to read articles and/or verify their
	consistancy in the spool given the message-id.

	The maximum number of parallel feeds from any given client may now
	be specified on a label-by-label basis.  It is still a per-ip
	limit so you can still collapse many different incoming feeds into a
	single label and have the label-specified limit work on a per-host
	basis.  see the 'maxconnect' definition in samples/dnewsfeeds

	Added 'nomismatch' option to dnewsfeeds (see samples/dnewsfeeds)
	to surpress MISMATCH testing of the incoming Path: header.

	Added '-c commonpath' option to diablo.  This adds a common path
	name to the Path: header if it does not already exist in the Path:
	header.  See the manual page for diablo.

	Fixed a bug in diablo that would cause the dnewsfeeds file to be
	read over and over again, eating cpu.

	Added sub-second realtime capability: the combination of rtflush in
	dnewsfeeds, and 'realtime' + 'd-1' in dnntpspool.ctl.  If the system
	supports usleep(), usleep(20000) is called (20 mS) rather then
	sleep(1).  May require some configuration munging for you system.
	Not suggested.

	BODY and ARTICLE nntp commands added.  Like the HEAD command, articles
	can be retrieved by message-id.

	dexpire will remove files called 'core' or '*.core' in the spool 
	directory as it comes across them.

Diablo V1.13

	Bug in spam cache file descriptor handling fixed... fcntl locks
	require us to obtain discrete descriptors by calling open() after
	any fork rather then before or they will not work properly if
	a process gets killed.  Due to the stability of diablo, this should
	not have caused any problems in 1.12, but needed to be fixed anyway.

	Bug in dnewslink quit code.. it would send the quit twice at the
	end which would result in an <interrupt/error> in the logs.  Apart
	from the bogus log message, the bug had no other effect.  This threw
	a few people off who were looking for errors when, in fact, there
	were none.

	Bug in dnewslink reconnect code.  When moving on to a new batchfile,
	does not fix StreamPend when pending streaming objects are refiled
	due to a timeout or remote close.  Would result in dnewslink exiting
	after processing one queue file rather then going on to the next 
	queue file.

	Bug in dnewslink close/reopen (for logging) code... it would again
	loose track of StreamPend.  It would also lose track of the number
	of potential receive bytes (which it calculates to guarentee that the
	server does not block writing responses back to the dnewslink client).

	Iain's latest diablo-stats included

Diablo V1.12

	The spam cache is turned on by default, for real this time.

	Added USE_PCOMMIT_SHM, USE_PCOMMIT_RW_MAP, DO_PCOMMIT_POSTCACHE,
	USE_SPAM_SHM, and USE_SPAM_RW_MAP.  *_RW_MAP causes the diablo to 
	use a shared r/w map rather then a read-only/lseek+write() mmap for 
	the precommit and/or spam caches.  << this will significantly improve
	the performance and stability of diablo >>.  If you set 
	USE_PCOMMIT_SHM, Diablo will use SYSV shared memory rather then a file
	mmap for the precommit cache.  If you set USE_SPAM_SHM, Diablo will
	use SYSV shared memory rather then a file mmap for the spam cache, but
	it will not be non-volatile storage so if you kill and restart diablo,
	the spam cache will get reset.  If you have sysv shared memory, you 
	want to set USE_PCOMMIT_SHM and DO_PCOMMIT_POSTCACHE at the very least.

	When shared memory is used for the spam filter, the spam.cache file
	(if it exists) will be loaded into shared memory when diablo is started
	and written out when the master diablo server exits.

	DO_PCOMMIT_POSTCACHE tells diablo to use the precommit cache to also
	cache dhistory lookups and commits.  It is not suggested that you
	use this feature unless you also set USE_PCOMMIT_SHM or at least
	set USE_PCOMMIT_RW_MAP.  Many lookups will hit the precommit cache 
	and thus avoid hitting the dhistory file, greatly reducing internal
	kernel filesystem lock contention and disk I/O on the dhistory file

	The FreeBSD 2.2.x, IRIX, and Solaris config automatically
	turn on the new precommit features.

	Casts the pointer argument to setsockopt() to void * to avoid
	compiler warnings on solaris (which still uses arcane 'char *' in
	its prototypes rather then 'void *').

	The bytes= logging for the marks by dnewslink was incorrect, it was 
	logging cumulative bytes rather then deltas for the marks.

	Added 'rtflush' to dnewsfeeds.  This option causes the queue file to
	be flushed on every line rather then buffered.  Useful when used with
	'realtime' in dnntpspool.ctl.

	Added Path: name checking.  If the first element of the Path: 
	received by an article does not match any 'alias' statements
	for the incoming connection, the IP address is prepended
	to the path: with .MISMATCH appended.

 *	>>> NOTE <<< you should grep through newly created spool 
	directories every so often looking for .MISMATCH in the spool
	files to locate incoming feeds with improperly configured
	'alias's (in dnewsfeeds).  When I turned this feature on,
	I found that four of my 80+ feeds were misconfigured.

	DNewsfeeds file processing moved to the main diablo server and 
	removed from the children, saving parsing and memory overhead
	of around 45K per child in heavy loaded diablo systems (x 100
	processes = 4.5 MBytes saved).

	Queue-delay 'q#' option added to dnntpspool.ctl.  This allows you
	to tell diablo to purposefully delay N queue files before transfering
	a feed to a destination, thus introducing a feed delay on purpose.
	This feature can be used to hold articles while allowing control 
	messages to propogate, getting the cancels in front of the articles 
	being canceled.

	Diablo now uses it's own memory allocation code in order to better
	manage memory.  This has simplified certain memory management 
	operations, such as when the parent forks and needs to deallocate
	memory pools that the child will not use.

	Minor fix to dnewslink: Now exits if it gets a 400 return
	code (ERR_GOODBYE) rather then retry the connection.

	Reverse dns lookup now uses case insensitive compare against forward
	lookup.

	The post-fork openlog() for syslog was being called prior to the
	mass file descriptor closures.  Moved so it is called after.  Doh!

	Beta 64 bit support (e.g. linux on 64 bit alphas and such)

Diablo V1.11	-- NOTE: new pseudo groups control.* added to the group list
		   for control messages.  This requires some minor
		   modifications to your dnewsfeeds file so you do not get
		   all control messages when taking a partial feed.  See
		   below.

	Added control.* pseudo groups.  If an article is a control message,
	the control message type is appended to the list of newsgroups
	as 'control.MESSAGETYPE'.  For example, a cancel is appended to
	the list of newsgroups as 'control.cancel'.  

	This means that if you do an 'addgroup *' then use delgroup to remove
	the groups you don't want, YOU WILL STILL RECEIVE CONTROL MESSAGES
	FOR ALL GROUPS.  The solution is to put a 'delgroup control.*' after
	the 'addgroup *' for all of your normal feeds.  If you do this,
	only control messages for the groups that pass the filter will be 
	propogated.

	If you use the more standard 'delgroup *' followed by 'addgroup ...'
	lines for the groups you want, the delgroup covers it and no 
	modifications are required for that feed.

	I have added another filter command called 'requiregroup'.  It is
	similiar to addgroup, delgroup, and delgroupany.  What it does,
	however, is require that the specified group BE in the Newsgroups
	list.  This allows you to create a secondary feed to your newsreader
	boxes containing ONLY the control messages that also pass your normal
	group filters by appending 'requiregroup control.*' to the end
	of your addgroup/delgroup filter commands.  Please see the example in
	the samples/dnewsfeeds file for more information.    Note that control
	bypasses generally require two dnewsfeeds labels, one for non-control
	messages and one for control messages.

	Changed a bunch of printf's for stdout to fprintf's for stderr.

	samples/dnewsfeeds incorrectly described the 'alias' command in
	the comments, fixed.

 	Added Iain's bytes= stats to diablo and his latest stats stuff 
	to contrib.  Also added -h option to diablo (see man page).

	'T' and 'R' parameters in dnntpspool.ctl now work, allowing you to
	set the transmit and receive buffer sizes on a connection-by-connection
	basis.  

	dnewslink now calls the socketopt to set the transmit/receive buffer
	sizes after the connect as well as before, in case the connect()
	call overrides the first ones (which it does on FreeBSD and linux
	boxes, since the route table dictates nominal buffering parameters)

	Ability to set the dhistory hash table size in the diload command.
	The default is 4 million entries, equivalent to the '-h 4m' option
	to diload.  Each hash table entry is 4 bytes, so 4 million entries
	results in a 16MByte hash table.  The hash table size must be a power
	of 2, so the next logical step is -h 8m (32 MBytes) or
	-h 16m (64 MBytes).  If your news box has a lot of memory, changing
	your biweekly.atrim script (see the adm directory for a sample) to
	generate a larger hash table will greatly reduce the load on the
	/news partition. 

	'-n' and '-f configfile' options added to dspoolout.  Minor adjustments
	made to realtime code to handle a race condition between diablo 
	creating the realtime spoolfile and dspoolout trying to open it.

	Minor adjustments made to realtime code in dnewslink to handle a
	race condition between diablo creating the realtime spoolfile and
	dnewslink closing out the previous one and openning the next one.

	DNewslink now sends the 'quit' command at the end of the session
	and waits for a response.

	Fixed another session reporting bug, diablo was not logging the
	correct number of elapsed seconds (non critical).

	New options added for lib/vendor.h.  You can set the USE_SHORT_REMEMBER
	define to 1 to use a shorter history retention for didump -x & diablo,
	or you can leave that option commented out and specify a specific
	REMEMBERDAYS.  The default remember is 14 days, the default short 
	remember is 7 days.  Diablo adds a bit of slop internally to deal with
	Date: conversion errors.  Usually the bottleneck that develops
	first is in access to the dhistory file.  A shorter remember/retention 
	can significantly improve access times.

	    /* #undef USE_SHORT_REMEMBER */
	    /* #define USE_SHORT_REMEMBER 1 */

	    /* #define REMEMBERDAYS 9 */

	NOTE(!) always be sure to recompile diablo completely when making
	#define option changes.  'xmake clean; xmake'.  The history retention
	is especially sensitive since it must be properly compiled into both
	the DIDUMP and DIABLO binaries.  If you update one but not the other
	it is possible to get into article transfer loops with your peers.

	Diablo now identifies itself on 502's rather then using the same
	error essage as INN.

Diablo V1.10

	The ME label in dnewsfeeds must be renamed to DEFAULT, which is
	more appropriate to how it works.  A new GLOBAL label is now optional.
	See samples/dnewsfeeds for more information.

	SPAM FILTER - based on NNTP-Posting-Host: header frequency in messages.
	Defaults to ON.  See the sample dnewsfeeds file for examples of
	how to program the spam filter.   The -S0 option to diablo will turn
	it off, or you can simply 'delspam *' in the GLOBAL label to turn it
	off.  To use this filter, you need to specify 'delspam' lines in
	the GLOBAL filter to handle non-spam sources that exceed the rate
	limit (which defaults to 16 postings within 16 minutes).  The
	samples/dnewsfeeds file contains a simple filter set.  You will
	also want to 'delspam *' for the incoming feeds from your leaf
	node shell machines.  

	However, since this sort of rate filter may become more common-place 
	on the internet, another solution will have to be found for 
	shell-based news readers if the posting rate exceeds 16 postings 
	per minute.  This spam filter is NOT PERFECT.  There are plenty of 
	cases where it can potential filter non-spam, but it works well
	enough for us that I've installed it on BEST's newsfeeds box.

	NEAR-REALTIME OUTGOING FEEDS - dspoolout/dnewslink now have the 
	capability to 'hang' on the diablo's outgoing feed file, initiating
	transactions with the destination host as the diablo server makes
	data available.  Since the diablo server buffers feed data, this
	is considered to be only near-realtime.  The lag is around 5 seconds
	for a full feed.  You can also explicitly flush diablo's queue files
	with 'dicmd flush' from a cron job to support slower n.r.t. feeds.
	'dicmd flush' is considerably cheaper to execute then 'dspoolout'.
	dspoolout would then only need to be run once every 30 minutes or so.
	The original queue file mechanism still works and runs in parallel
	as a failsafe, resulting in double the message-id load on the 
	destinations designated for realtime operation.  See the dspoolout
	manual page for more information.

	dspoolout was not handling the min-flush-seconds option exactly right.
	It should now do a better job with it, only using it if the queue 
	files are truely backed up.

	dnewslink now turns on SO_KEEPALIVE to prevent infinite hangs.
	Diablo already did this.

	Fixed minor bug in Date: parsing on incoming feeds.  It prevented
	the article-too-old stuff from working properly.

	Fixed minor bug in header scanning - Diablo was not detecting the
	end-of-headers blank line properly and scanning headers on into
	the body of the article.

	A bottleneck for dhistory file appends has been removed.  Previously,
	an exclusive lock was used to append to the file (O_APPEND is not
	dependable).  Now we 'allocate' space with a record lock in a 
	non-blocking fashion.  History adds are now much faster under extreme
	loads.

	diload throws away history file entries with zero'd gm timestamps or
	zero'd hash codes.

	The size of the send and receive tcp socket buffers can be specified
	in dspoolout, dnewslink, and diablo now with command line options
	(-T and -R)

	Diablo now properly logs the elapsed time on disconnect.

	NOTE: addition to adm/biweekly.atrim sample, the dhistory.bak
	file is now removed before the new dhistory file is generated to
	make more space on the disk.  This allows a 1.5G /news partition to
	continue to be used in the face of growing history files.

	'dicmd status' added, returns diablo's current status

	The unix domain socket is created after diablo switches to the 'news'
	user rather then before.

	-M option added to diablo.  This limits the maximum number of 
	simultanious connections allowed from EACH remote host.  The limit
	cannot yet be set on a per-feed basis.  This option is designed
	to prevent system failures from out of control remotes. 

Diablo V1.09

	Major bug in dnewslink found by Michael S. McMahon.  When dnewslink
	gets interrupted and refiles pending stream transactions back to 
	the batch file, it was not refiling the offset,size part!   A rerun 
	would thus result in the entire article spool file (encompassing many 
	articles) to be sent as a single article.  Ouch.

	Precommit caching added.  Diablo now generates and maintains a
	pcommit.cache file which it mmap's.  This file contains a
	static 4096-entry hash table.  Message-id's for check and ihave
	commands are entered into the hash table and timeout after 30 seconds.
	hash table collisions are simply overwritten.  During the time which
	a message-id is active, other check/ihave commands for the id will
	return a DUPlicate response code.   The precommit caching will get
	rid of 98% of the article collisions when you have several incoming
	feeds that are mostly synchronized with each other.  In this situation,
	the precommit caching will reduce your incoming network load by at 
	least a factor of 2 as well as reduce the disk write load.

	Three new statistical elements have been added: predup, posdup, and
	pcoll.  (predup and posdup were actually added in V1.08).  predup
	counts the number of history collisions that occur as of the
	beginning of a 'takethis' command.  posdup counts the number of history
	collisions that occur as of the article commit after a 'takethis'
	command, and pcoll counts the number of pcommit cache collisions
	which cause check/ihave to return a DUPlicated status.

	The random seed used to generate file names was not being re-randomized
	after a fork.  Oops!  It is now.

	Replaced stdio routines used for socket input by diablo with custom
	routines, removing the fileno(fi) = -1 problem and working around
	apparent stdio bugs in SunOs, Solaris, and IRIX.

	Article reception can deal with 8-bit-clean data now, as long as it
	is properly '.' escaped.  This includes removing the CR before an LF
	for storage and adding it back in for retransmission.

	Added 'd' option to dnntpspool.ctl, allowing one to specify a startup
	delay for the dnewslink's related to a particular site.

	statvfs fixes made for sun/solaris.  I got several diffs and chose
	the easiest one.  It may still not be entirely compatible with
	all sunos/solaris implementations.

	The control file dspoolout uses (dnntpspool.ctl) can now be overriden
	on the command line.

	You can now specify the outbound (bind) ip address for dnewslink...
	useful if you have multiple interfaces and want to split outgoing
	traffic amoungst them, or if you have multiple interfaces and your 
	peers expect the news to come in from a particular IP.  This can
	also be specified in dnntpspool.ctl.  DSpoolout will pass it on to
	DNewslink.  See samples/dnntpspool.ctl for an example.

	New version of Iain's stats package.

Diablo V1.08	*** NOTE ** DHISTORY FILE RELOAD REQUIRED IF UPGRADING ***

	** HISTORY AND SPOOL FILE FORMAT CHANGE.  The format change requires
	   that you ensure that ALL of your diablo binaries are replaced.  You
	   must regenerate your dhistory file

	Major stability fixes to dhistory file operation... I have found that
	if the /news partition runs out of space or many processes are
	write()ing to dhistory in O_APPEND mode, that O_APPEND writes aren't
	as atomic as I thought they were.   dhistory appends are now
	serialized and *ACTIVELY* realigned if their alignment gets screwed
	up.  This should make the dhistory file much, much, much more robust.

	Major stability fixes to dqueue files.  Feeds no longer must be
	flushed on fork, and files are written in multiples of one line.
	If a write files, the file is truncated to remove the partial line
	in order to prevent corruption if a disk fills up.

	Stability fixes to article files... now does a sanity check (looks 
	for the \0 terminator for the article in a multi-article file) to
	catch corrupted files.

	didump -x does a better job filtering out bogus dhistory entries.

	Major, Major, Major changes in the spool file format, dhistory file
	format, and queue file format.  Read the section at the end of the
	INSTALL file for instructions on how to upgrade without blowing up
	your news server.

	    * spool files may now contain multiple articles separated by \0.
	      spool files are now named solely based on their gmtime and
	      iteration number.

	    * queue files include offset/length pairs to allow dnewslink to
	      access the new spool files.

	    * The dhistory file now has a proper header structure, and History
	      entries now contain two additional fields (offset, bytes) .. used
	      to store the offset,length information for article lookups.

	The dynamic pipe sizing has been removed from dnewslink.  It 
	doesn't work very well when feeds get behind and just slows
	things down more.

        dexpire is temporarily braindead... it now expires in straight FIFO
        fashion, so most of dexpire.ctl is no longer relevant (except for
        expirations of 0 which cause an article to be rejected)... I have
        a medium term plan to make expiration specifications work again, but
        it will be a few releases at the very least.


	diablo, dnewslink, and dexpire now use chdir() caching to reduce
	the path lengths for remove(), open(), etc... which is a big win
	for the kernel.

	diablo now records rejection statistics properly.  It previously
	did not count.

	diablo now records and returns the errno error string on fatal 
	errors.

	addition of 'delgroupany' command to dnewsfeeds file.  Similar
	to 'delgroup', except acts the same as INN's '@group'... i.e.
	if the group appears in the Newsgroups line at all, the article
	is rejected, even if there are other groups in the line that pass 
	the filter.

	addition of 'maxpath' command to dnewsfeeds file.  Allows you
	to filter feed based on the number of elements in the Path: 
	header.

	addition of the 'groupdef' command and 'groupref' command (see the
	sample dnewsfeeds file).  Rather then repeat the same group access
	list over and over again in each feed, you can now collect them
	together in one place and reference them from your feeds.

	statvfs support added for SUN.

Diablo V1.07	- ** NOTE ** YOU MUST READ THE 'INSTALL' FILE IF UPGRADING
		  TO THIS RELEASE FROM 1.05 OR LOWER !!!

	The diablo server now has the ability to bind to a specific host and/or
	ip address.

	diablo converts the reverse-lookup hostname to lowercase before 
	comparing against hosts in the diablo.hosts file.

	'nostream' option now available for dnntpspool.ctl for dnewslink runs.

	Diablo now rejects articles when the message-id in the article
	body does not match the message-id in the ihave or takethis header,
	and logs the mismatch.  Diablo previously stored the ihave/takethis
	message-id into the history file without checking it against the
	message-body.  If a mismatch occurs, the article is rejected.
	(should I do a 400+exit instead?)

	Misc small bug fixes to diablo

	Diablo now returns a 400 error code and exits if a file error occurs.
	It previously returned a 431 error code, which was incorrect.  400 
	isn't exactly correct either, since it requires diablo to exit.  We
	need another return code to allow the server to indicate a problem yet
	not exit (i.e. let the client decide to exit).

Diablo V1.06	- ** NOTE ** YOU MUST READ THE 'INSTALL' FILE IF UPGRADING
		  TO THIS RELEASE!!!!

	The default hash table size for dhistory will become USE_LARGE_HASH
	in this upcoming release.  If you wish to maintain a small hash table
	size (e.g. you are taking a partial feed), you must set the 
	USE_SMALL_HASH define to 1 in lib/vendor.h

	dnewslink will still attempt to send news if the (nntp) server 
	responds with code 201 rather then code 200.

	** It is suggested that the dclean admin script be run twice a week
	   rather then once a day due to it's load on the history file

	dnewslink now dynamically adjusts the size of the pipe for streaming
	feeds.  If dnewslink detects an inordinate number of 
	check/ok/takethis/reject collisions, it reduces the size of the
	pipeline.  The pipeline is also dynamically adjusted back up when
	the collisions subside.

	More /bin/sh script fixes in contrib/XMakefile... improper semicolons
	removed.

        Fixed bug in dexpire that caused it to loop endlessly without getting
	much work done.

	Added parallel-tasking option, -p# (as in -p4) to dexpire, causing it
	to fork N times in order to run multiple unlink()'s in parallel
	without the processes stepping over each other's feet.

Diablo V1.05

	Switched from whole-file locks on dhistotry to record locks.  Diablo
	was having lock starvation problems due to the large number of 
	processes accessing the history file.

	By using record locks, we lock a particular hash chain rather then
	the entire file.  This should make machines with a large number of 
	feeds more efficient.

	EFFICIENCY NOTICE:  We strongly suggest that you set the 
	USE_LARGE_HASH define to 1 in lib/vendor.h and follow the 
	instructions at the end of the INSTALL file to increase the
	size of the dhistory file hash table.  Doing so will yield a
	major increase in efficiency on machines with limited buffer caches.
	Specifically, a 128MB machine may not have enough free space for
	a good buffer cache and the large number of seek/reads caused
	by the smaller hash table can result in seek starvation on /news.

Diablo V1.04

	Fixed a 436 return code into a 431 return code for streaming 
	'try it again' responses.

	Now uses floating point to store and log byte and article totals

	Fixed bug in the article totaling (for logs) - Diablo was reporting
	more received articles then were actually received in the DIABLO
	log line.

	Diablo incoming now logs every 1024 articles rather then every 1000
	for a better looking K/M/G log line.

	Added 'maxcross' and 'maxsize' filters for outgoing feeds.

Diablo V1.03

	Uses mmap() to allocate memory, either via MAP_ANON or MAP_PRIVATE,
	allowing us to easily deallocate it from the page table on fork.
	We use this for stdio buffers as well as for pipe line buffers.

	Added doutq

	More portability fixes:  directory stuff, signal stuff, etc...

Diablo V1.02

	Fixed two file descriptor leaks in the main server.  There are not
	likely to be any more.

	Made portability changes:  uses sigaction() rather then signal(),
	and uses fcntl() rather then flock() (though SUN should get it's
	act together and implement flock().. it's trivial).

Diablo V1.01

	Moved some .SET's from XMakefile to XMakefile.inc

	The sample crontab in adm/ ran the once-every-four-hours
	expire once a minute instead, and I didn't notice!

	dnewslink now reports local/remote latency properly.  Well,
	as well as can be done, anyway, and also reports the size
	of the article in debug mode.

Diablo V1.00

	Initial Release
